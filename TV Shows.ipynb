       " ' theory very cool theory about the flies and dolores that i saw on another forum one thing that stuck with me and i ve been thinking about the entire day and which i finally figured out why it stuck with me is the importance of the fly and i m not merely talking about the ending scene in the opening scene it s established that the hosts don t react to them as one crawls across delores eye then there s the piece of dialogue about how a host could never hurt a human they couldn t even hurt a fly this obviously seems like a setup for the ending scene but there s an even more important scene about it the one where the sheriff starts to malfunction when he s escorting the guests because what s important here is what happens precisely before he starts malfunctioning a fly lands on his face why is this important because of what is being discussed about the hosts in other scenes about the reveries allowing them to pick up small touches details in human behavior and imitate them so they appear more lifelike such as the hooker from the saloon rubbing her lips and the sheriff when fixed combing his mustache with his fingers so to bring that back to the fly what is the most subconscious instinctive move a person makes when a fly lands on them they swat it and i think we all know that we do it without even thinking about it so what happens when the hosts constantly register the guests doing this they want to start imitating it but to do so they would intent on killing the fly and this goes directly against their core programming and thus unaware to the programmers they have created a paradox in their system one that is causing them to glitch this brings a lot more meaning to the end scene because it doesn t just mean that dolores has somehow overcome the glitch but this means that her ai is evolved far ahead of the other hosts in the park and we already know why this is because of what is said about her towards the end namely that she is the oldest host in the park which means she contains more reveries than any other host in the park the same reveries that stand at the core of the hosts changing behavior so we really already know why and how she has overcome her programming and this leads me to theorize that she is in fact so far ahead of the other hosts that she is evolved even far beyond what the programmers think is going on and that she has been playing along for a while now ',\n",
       " 'as a gamer watching westworld was especially thought provoking i really enjoyed the pilot of this show and as a gamer i was especially interested in how it seemed to directly be riffing on gamer dev behavior as my wife put it after the episode its like a bunch of red dead redemption npc s woke up and decided to get revenge on the player i get the sense that this take seems to be very intentional early in the episode one of the guests discusses how on his last visit he did a straight evil playthrough in much the same way i might do a renegade playthrough in mass effect ed harris character seems to the hosts like a terrifying villain but from his perspective he s just trying to unlock achievements and hidden content in a game he s played through a million times over the park s lead writer painstakingly crafts a villain s dramatic monologue only to be frustrated when an overeager guest just shoots the villain mid speech a problem many an open world game designer has surely wrestled with in one form or another its too early in the show to definitively state what the show s larger point is other than enslaving and torturing ai s for entertainment is bad but as a gamer i thought it was pretty thought provoking tv the park s guests in the show don t see themselves as evil in any real sense they aren t shooting real people they re shooting elaborate animatronics set up to mimic real people any damage done will be erased by the next day so why not just indulge their darker impulses do a renegade playthrough get that wanted level westworld raises the question of how good ai has to get before this justification no longer holds water and whether once that bridge had been crossed we d even notice as someone who has done multiple rdr playthroughs including an evil one it definitely got me thinking the show s audience is immediately made to sympathize with the hosts and regard the guests as somewhere between boorish buffoons and total monsters what sociopathic assholes they are but from the guests perspective is it really any different than just killing an annoying npc in skyrim or going on a rampage in gta or to use a less virtual example if someone jokingly punched one of those annoying musical animatronic at chuck e cheese at worst we d call it property damage and the animatronics at westworld unlike the ones at chuck e cheese are expressly designed for that sort of treament its ok for someone to do evil shit in video games because they aren t real it can even be a healthy outlet if someone s feeling pissed off far better they go gun down demons in doom than lash out in the real world is a sentiment expressed in one form or another by many many gamers including myself the mentality of the guests in westworld is exactly the same and while we the audience know they re wrong the guests don t to the man in black what he s doing is really no different from someone trying to max out their stars in gta or trying out an evil bioware playthrough after having played a game for years no one is actually being hurt in any real way the hosts are just a mashup of video game npcs and lifelike realdolls and by the next day any damage one had done will be totally erased from the guests perspective whats the harm right its a mentality that should be very familiar to anyone whose ever played video games that give you license to behave badly or mistreat npc s i also like that this show isn t just putting us the audience under this critical lens its also doing the same thing to the creators the writer character in particular feels like a direct metacommentary on game developers in a way its sort of the classic turing test issue how do you know if a robot is really sentient or just presenting a perfect fascimile of sentience the park s been running for decades as we saw with old bill the older models were more obviously inhuman in their movements and speech well crafted npc s but not actually people with each generation and update since then they ve become progressively more lifelike more human seeming in their presentation but for the park s guests and employees its all just advancing along the same continuum of making things that look and sound like real thinking living beings but are actually just well scripted animatronics as far as the guests are aware any agency or self awareness is just one more part of the script in our own world how advanced and convincing would a video game npc s ai need to become before we were prepared to give it human rights is there even such a point i m not sure there is basically gamers pretty regularly treat npc s in ways that would be monstrous if they were actual people at the same time each generation of games seems developers working harder to develop more convincing npc s with more fleshed out dialogue and characterization a broader and more in depth range of responses to potential player actions etc westworld simply carries both of these patterns forward to its logical conclusion that if at some point a game dev actually did develop real artificial intelligence whether on purpose or by accident players would be so conditioned to see npc thoughts and emotions as fake that we wouldn t even notice and would carry on being bastards until npc s somehow got the agency to resist usually when media tries to comment on video game morality its hamhanded and clunky and tipper gore esque playing violent games will make you a school shooter type nonsense westworld is really the first show i ve ever seen that has made me ask myself tough

malfunctioning sheriff is a way to introduce the troublesome update introduced by ford and so transfer blame to him and distract attention away from bernard more on this update later on as it is a hint on the story arc for multiple series imho a guest makes a comment about teddy saying that he creeps me out so by making teddy seem unusual we get a way of pairing dolores amp teddy as it is obvious later on that dolores has access to some hidden code making her an equally unusual host during the initial man in black encounter with dolores he says that he is puzzled about their pairing a black family meets dolores by the river and the boy says to her that she is not real this is an activation code for dolores to allow her to fool the subsequent investigation at the end of the episode the black family have been sent to the park by bernard to protect dolores dolores s father finds a photo from years ago the photo is of bernard wife who was massacred in the professor cult story line and the photo would not have survived so long in the ground it was planted there by bernard as a trigger code for dolores s father during the final diagnostic check of the sheriff bernard looks at a photo of his son amp says to the sheriff that he sometimes envies his forgetfulness meaning that bernard is human amp that he lost his son i suggest that the man in black amp bernard both lost family members during a massacre when the professor horror story line went off script years ago the man in black was given a free pass in return for never leaving the park and thereby keeping the massacre a secret now after indulging his personal trauma and revenge and turning into a monster he is looking for the main control complex illustrated as a copyright symbol in the scalp map and shown in a partial brief aerial view for a moment earlier in the episode so that he can get his revenge on the park management bernard for his part is working from within the programming team to get revenge and so he is quite happy to accept the recall of malfunctioning hosts because it can hide his own update plan to use the dolores amp teddy in some way the scene between ford amp bernard when ford says we are the product of a trillion mistakes is a clever clue to the extended story arc that is fords scientific journey is to go beyond the haphazard evolutionary process to a better form of life and make less mistakes in the development this is his utopian vision hence his comment it means that we are done of course bernard has other plans of some kind part revenge for the death of his family part programming hubris and also being a part of the overall management plan a plan that is not necessarily compatible with ford s pure idealist plan bernard is planting his own updates in the hosts he whispers something to the decommissioned father before he is left in cold storage after all both ford amp bernard are brilliant minds each playing the game of life both of them cannot resist the temptation to become more powerful than power itself but i digress the first series will end with the man in black breaking into the management complex the conflict between bernard amp fords update plans for the hosts will be developed both brilliant minds are trying to create a revolution not run a commercial theme park an aberrant host will kidnap or kill a guest i have to admit that there is too much guess work here although the clues are there amp more to come in the next couple of episodes i would say that the story arc will clearly be more complex amp thought provoking than i have suggested i hope so now the interview scene between ford amp the father the blade runner homage was wonderful amp obvious even including a couple of bars of vangelis music in the conversation when the father is asked about his itinerary he says he wants to meet his maker and so i wish they had done the full homage and have ford reply and what can he do for you as tyrell says to roy in blade runner that is made up for however by the chilling mechanical amp dirty hand lines a few moments later and you could argue that when the father is asked to access his current build he says a rose is a rose and that is subtle homage to the hal computer take down when it sings the daisy song but i admit that is a wild leap of my programmed imagination if you want a wild journey into the technical details of android technology read this book search kindle books for android rebellion the future is a paradox apparently written by a retired programmer black ops guy if you believe the author info i don t buy it but who knows if this promotion is unforgivable then i will have to be recalled to remove the aberrant update before that however i will break into westworld amp ask the sheriff to post the

       " 'analysis of opening sequence of westworld in television shows often times the main title sequences serve a two fold purpose it introduces you to the people behind the show and it provides some small exposition in house of cards the main title sequence reveals that setting as washington d c and with its focus on shots of historical landmarks suggests it will explore a topic that is foundational to the society it explores similarly the opening sequence of the night of sets the location and central subject of the show as a metropolitan crime scene piecing together each individual shot from the sequence reveals this central storyline each of those two shows however does not provide nearly the same thematic depth in the main title sequence as is exhibited in westworld hbo s new show does not just reveal its main plot point and topic in the opening sequence it hints at where it may go the very opening shot of the sequence already plays mind games with the viewer s perception on an initial viewing this opening shot appears to be a sunrise coming over a hill in a landscape as the sun rises however we see it is too white and the landscape is a course white surface aberrations in what the viewer initially identified as a sun reveals that it is instead a bright light bulb in just the first three seconds of this sequence the viewer becomes aware that this show is going to constantly be challenging his her perceptions the sequence cuts to a shot of a robotic arm creating one of the strings of a piano and this linear drawing process is replicated in the consequent shot depicting what one would suspect is the fibula of a human leg the next shot connects the fibula to a joint presumably the knee then viewer s expectations are shattered once more as the sequence cuts within continuity to a horse mid gallop still being constructed by a similar machine it cuts once more displaying a fully functional horse galloping in between these robotic arms it is clear that this show will play with the viewer s perceptions what is it that you are really seeing yet here we finally get a hint at what we will be seeing equine beauty is almost the essence of natural splendor here it is mechanically created this is the intersection of natural beauty and manmade wonder this juxtaposition can be extended to its limits to serve as real and fabrication in addition this horse scene potentially acts as a tribute to sallie gardner at gallop a series of photographs proving that all four feet of a horse are off the ground during a gallop which served as one of the precursors to film the sequence leaves the horse but provides a similar mechanical continuity as it progresses to the construction of an eye which as humans we once again presume to be human presented with another angle of the eye the viewer identifies a large rock atop a cliff in the reflection of the eye those familiar with westerns will identify this rocky structure as one of the cornerstones of western landscapes which provides some location exposition however the viewer has learned not to trust it and it is clear from its positioning within the eye that this landscape is not all it seems the eye is the center of human perception and seeing is believing as they say yet this natural landscape contradicts the mechanical nature of its construction is this just a steeped in film school education way of saying there s more to this than meets the eye perhaps but it serves its purpose the most complex natural element the human eye meets the most simplistic natural wonder a gorgeous vista once again the extremes of complexity and simplicity meet in a shot of this opening sequence the eye is created and bones continue to be made this time a hand playing the piano whose song has been the score to the opening sequence the sequence cuts and these two human like bodies caress each other sexually this trend of mechanical reproducibility of the most natural events and urges is now firmly cemented this is no accidental over reading of a sequence of shots the juxtaposition between natural and manmade has been pushed to its limits over and over again clearly this will be a central theme of the show to come yet as the sequence continues to recapitulate all of these intersections and complications it reaches a threshold the human hands come up from the keys of the piano as they do the montage of these mechanical images continue but the djawadi s score begins to hit different notes and slightly change it is a troubling foreshadowing even though these hands are not natural real human hands they still signify the human control as they leave however the piano takes on a life of its own and it does not abide by its own sheet music dictated the historical progression of the score can the machine change its own script are these manmade constructions going to escape the control of the creators and become capable of creating their own songs their own realities the opening sequence suggests so westworld manages to surpass the minimum expectation of exposition and succinctly and cleverly manages to foreshadow future plot conflicts in its expression of the major themes of the show through its tactical juxtapositions ',\n",

       " ' theory man in black ok so my theory is the man in black is a robot that was part of the critical failure that happened years ago and is trying to escape westworld years and bullets the episode opens up with him saying he has been visiting for years and we later find out there was a critical failure years ago i would imagine these numbers are not coincidences so why can t hosts shoot him if he s not a guest i believe the way westworld separates guests and hosts is by a registry all hosts are registered into the system while guests are probably not and each host has a token that identifies them as a host when we see teddy go to shoot mib the bullet is fired and appears to stop and not penetrate mib as if westworld checks the object the bullet comes in contact with if the object is registered in westworld as a host it allows the bullet to penetrate them but if not this would be any guest the bullet is destroyed the reason mib is not registered is because he was a robot that survived the disaster and is not supposed to be in this new westworld that was fixed after the critical update possibly planted by ford but nonetheless is an unintended inhabitant of westworld and not being registered means he is treated as a guest by the system but without actually being a guest its why hes been there for years since the disaster he has been stuck and unable to leave yet learning all the truths about it and how the world is fake scalping mib kidnaps the card dealer but doesn t kill him if he was a human and just wanted to scalp the guy for the map inside his head why not just kill him and scalp him he cuts his throat but keeps him alive only to drag him through the night far away and drain all but liters of his blood to then scalp him and get the map he intentionally didn t want him dead and he says this but why didn t he want him dead with maintenance of the park and all the hosts each probably has a device that detects when they die and their location so the staff can quickly locate the host to repair it and insert back into westworld i believe mib knows this so he doesn t want the card dealer dying because he doesn t want the card dealer being found and his plan of finding these clues being uncovered which would expose himself if he was a human paying and playing a game then getting exposed wouldn t matter as a customer but as a robot not supposed to be there he needs to keep himself hidden so he keeps the card dealer alive and drags him far away so no one sees him no other androids identify him as dead and the staff never knows the character missing or assumes him missing is a guest doing and they don t bother finding him until the guest kills him which under mib watch won t happen until he s done with him and he is finished with the map as we see its pretty clear the thing under the scalp is a map and i imagine a map in a fixed landscape like westworld isn t helpful for a guy who has spent years there so its not a map of the place but a map out of the place and into the real world rape and murder of dolores as a robot he would have no need to just kill teddy and rape dolores but as a robot trying to escape he would need to disguise his actions as that of a guest so if he needs to get information out of dolores or possibly corrupt her to use her as a trojan horse of sorts he needs to do it and make it look like things a guest would do so he does his typical guest activities so the staff won t notice anything unusual when they come in to clean up he can t alter storylines too much because he can t have it stand out that the things that happened weren t the doing of paid guests so its taken him a long time years possibly to gather all the information and understanding to begin an escape a long time and waiting for the right updates to be able to plot it and get other hosts to be on board or be manipulated enough to help in his escape episode trailer we see in the trailer thandie newtons character is in the real world undergoing maintenance when she wakes up and has consciousness grabbing a knife and escaping her room only to collapse in a hallway later in the trailer we see her defending herself from mib and it appearing to look like him killing her i believe mib kills her on purpose and possibly implants something into her to bring out into the real world if he knows a hosts death tags them to be brought in for repair why he didn t kill the card dealer i believe he kills her on purpose to use her as a trojan horse either to bring something into the real world or to bring something back to westworld ford and management there is some agenda for management we don t know but it seems there is an agenda for ford that is more obvious he is found conversing with an old obsolete host still being fond of it he isn t frightened by peter abernathy wanting to meet his maker he has quoted wanting to be god and be like the devil he is obsessive with westworld and the hosts and wants to make them more human the reveries were not a mistake he did it on purpose to try and start evolution in the hosts management does seem to want to make a change to order and seems to want ford out their agenda isn t quite clear but i imagine its slightly different than fords i m betting ford wants his androids to be life like and so much so he doesn t want them prisoners in westworld but free in the real world i think ford might be driving the escape planting the map on the card dealer for mib to find possibly helping him when thandie newton is the trojan horse to slip something back in westworld and he may have planted the photograph used to begin the chaos that we expect with the host revolt his agenda is probably in line with mib since if mib is a host from the previous system before the critical failure then he is a creation of ford and one of his oldest a creation he wants to see freed from imprisonment along with freeing all of his children the other hosts in the trailer for the show mib is seen saying i m here to set you free this scene hasn t happened yet and i believe it will happen when he has managed to make his escape mib is looking for a backdoor to escape from westworld and with it he will free the other hosts to escape he could be a human wanting to free the hosts for ethical reason but then why indulge in rape and murder if hes against their imprisonment and a human because he is a robot trying to escape from a world he isn t supposed to be in and knowing he is enslaved by his maker and the staff he feels he might as well free the others to have an army behind him when he gets out he s been planning it for years he was there for the last critical failure he will be the next critical failure ',\n",

       " 'the meaning of episode titles because a comment thread was no place for this monstrosity note i m going to edit this to add content in chunks a couple of times in the beginning so bare with me i just don t want to make you all nauseous with terrible formatting the more i think through these episode titles the more i think they re meant to seem simple when really they have multiple layers the original interpretation present or existing from the beginning first or earliest interpretation created directly and personally by a particular artist not a copy or imitation interpretation not dependent on other people s ideas inventive and unusual my take this is absolutely about delores but i think ford created her and i think he did so for a very specific reason in one of the trailers that was released prior to the start of the season we see him talking with her she looks at him inquisitively and asks are we old friends to which he replies i wouldn t say friends no i wouldn t say that at all there is something sinister about his relationship with her that goes beyond a bizarre attachment to his first creation think about it whomever created this character did so knowing she would wake up every morning full of hope they wouldn t just see her be brutally raped or who knows what else by various guests they would see a light go out in her over and over and over again this is a deeply personal act of vengeance we ll touch on that again later tldr delores was not only the original host she was also originally created for a unique purpose vengeance and will likely start displaying original thoughts of her own in coming episodes chestnut interpretation a large european tree that produces the edible chestnut that develops within a bristly case with serrated leaves and heavy timber interpretation british slang for an old or stale joke interpretation a piece of music in symphonic or other repertoire that has been played so much that many people are tired of it interpretation see chestnut blight a fungal infection affecting the american chestnut tree that had a devastating economic and social impact on communities in the eastern united states my take we know maeve is european during the episode they re trying to figure out why the guests don t seem to be interested in her any more both interpretation and three seem to reflect something that has been played or told so many times that listeners grow tired of hearing it interpretation could just be a coincidence or a small reference to the virus that is now seemingly spreading amongst the hosts but i m most interested in the first definition what if the key here is maeve s daughter or the young girl who appears to be her daughter in her flashback she also displays a few motherly attributes when talking to the other prostitute about her nightmares to take things a little further and creepier i think her nightmare might have been triggered by the place on her body that was being messed with as though that is a spot somehow connected to her traumatic memory interestingly it s seemingly similar to a place where a woman s womb would be lt br gt now you re thinking you re crazy they re robots they can t reproduce and i think you re right but if she was given a storyline in which she was a mother and programmed to believe that she was is there a chance they did something to trigger maternal instincts that involved her at least thinking she had a full female reproductive system tldr maeve is in a sense a joke no one is falling for and or a song people are tired of hearing she seemingly contracts the virus from delores and may believe that she has reproduced in the past and or have some underlying maternal instincts and behaviors left over from a previous storyline the stray interpretation not in the right place separated from the group or target interpretation a feral abandoned or escaped domestic animal interpretation in physics arising as a consequence of the laws of physics not by deliberate design and usually having detrimental effect on the operation or efficiency of equipment interpretation see stray bullet a bullet that after being fired from a gun hits an unintended target interpretation to be unfaithful interpretation reference to a novel published in great britain in by a n wilson wherein a cat with no true name tells his life story to his daughter and grandson he discusses tragic events in his life my take whatever little experiment ford and or bernard are partaking in which i ll cover later is going to take a turn for the worse when someone dies who isn t supposed to i don t know yet who it s going to be but something is going to happen that throws off everyone s story line and sends things into chaos i can also see this being related to the little scavenger hunt mib is on maybe the guy he has tied up behind his horse lawrence is missing something he isn t supposed to my last thought is that perhaps one of the hosts actually escapes admittedly though this is the one i think tells us the least dissonance theory leon festinger s theory of cognitive dissonance in psychology indicates that most humans feel a need to maintain consistency a month their thoughts values and beliefs people who recognize inconsistencies in their own thought patterns would likely feel discomfort and therefore make a change example if someone believes that having sex before marriage is morally wrong but starts partaking in a sexual relationship before marriage themselves they will likely change they re overall belief in order to avoid the discomfort of cognitive dissonance my take this is going to have something to do with recycling the hosts we re finding out that small traces of previous story lines have been left behind in an effort to recall certain mannerisms to use during improvisation but it s already pretty clear that it will do much more than that we ve seen through delores that every story line character doesn t just have a set of actions they follow they display a wide range of character traits unique backstories and distinct world views presumably then they have certain values or augmented moral compasses if traces of those values are left behind from one story line to the next and a host goes from playing the part of a cannibal to a loving father isn t it possible their value systems would be in stark contrast and potentially cause some serious internal conflict tldr hosts who used to play a bad guy that now play a good guy or vice versa are experiencing some phenomenon where they feel painfully conflicted without understanding why contrapasso contrapasso is the punishment of souls in dante s inferno usually through means directly opposing the sins they committed during their lives one of the most prevalent examples of contrapasso involves sorcerers astrologers and false prophets having their heads twisted around backward as punishment for trying to see into the future or falsely predict future events my take i think that s important if science technology is the magic of westworld then perhaps this is about punishing the creators programmers i also have a strange tin foil theory floating around somewhere in my mind telling me that everyone host in westworld was once a human being who committed some type of crime this was man kind s new and improved form a punishment replacing certain organs with technology and forcing them to live through the crimes they committed for eternity probably not the case but this episode title is the only thing that keeps me from writing it off entirely the adversary this one is my favorite there is so much to this word i can hardly stand it interpretation a person group or force that opposes or attacks interpretation hebrew word for satan interpretation science see adversarial collaboration a scientific experiment wherein two scientists with opposing hypotheses design and conduct an experiment that will satisfy both with limited bias interpretation computer science a malicious entity in cryptography whose aim is to prevent the users of the cryptosystem from achieving their goal my take ford and bernard are each to a degree mad scientists with very different perspectives about how to improve the technology at hand ford wants the hosts to evolve while bernard seems keen on preservation the one thing they both require to pursue their opposing goals memory to learn and advance the hosts need memory to preserve the past and potentially re animate someone who s been lost they need memory even if it s augmented memory i think ford has manipulated bernard into believing that he is partaking in adversarial collaboration by embarking on a joint experiment in a production environment but i think ford has no intention of containing he experiment and has not only deliberately created an adversary to keep bernard from achieving his end goal but also to keep anyone from stopping his work once the ball is rolling tldr ford and bernard are working together but only one of them has good intentions the other has added some form of programming to block the other from being successful and to keep people from stopping him trompe l oeil this is a french phrase for deceive the eye and is a type of art that uses realistic images to depict objects and fool the consumer into believing they actually exist in there is an old greek story tied to this concept that involves a competition of sorts between two painters it eventually ends when one asks the other to take a look at his latest work hanging behind a set of old curtains the other artist tries to move the curtains aside only to realize they are the painting and he has lost the contest my take the connection here between two competing artists or scientists is too perfect i definitely think ford even more so than anyone else sees this as a competition i think in this episode there will be some massive revelation and we will realize suddenly that something was not at all what it seemed and that something was put into place by ford for the purpose of fooling the company and or bernard personally i think we re going to find out the mib isn t actually human tldr there is a competition happening and a major piece of the show up to this point has been nothing more than an illusion created by one of the competitors trace decay in psychology the trace decay theory is one explanation for forgetting this theory suggests that memories leave some form of physical or chemical trace on the brain nervous system when that trace fades or deteriorates so does the memory associated with it therefore a memory would fade over a certain amount of time my take i think we re going to find out that even though these hosts have augmented nervous systems they re able to recall certain aspects of previous storylines because they re associated with specific physiological changes to their bodies if they sustained major trauma of some sort that memory is imprinted somehow and has the power to start dictating future behavior the well tempered clavier yes a clavier is a keyboard instrument but the well tempered clavier is a very specific collection of music by bach it is a two part series of preludes short introductory pieces and fugues complex multi voice thematic in major and minor keys each set compares pairs of the two this type of work was significant at that time because it was written for a well tuned tuning system as opposed to the meat one or accidental sounding tuning system at the time to this day there is debate on whether or not bach intended it for a range of similar temperaments those that may have been altered slightly or a well tempered consistent solution for all purposes bach noted that he had composed the first part for the profit and use of musical youth desirous of learning and especially for the pastime of those already skilled in this study my take this reminds me of the fundamental dispute between ford lee bernard regarding consistency bernard and ford seem to be ok changing the stakes they want the hosts to change and learn new things or be more convincing at improvisation but lee doesn t like how human these things are getting he doesn t like that they can act out and throw off his story lines in the blink of an eye i think we re going to learn that winding the environment so tightly only made it three times as likely to implode ',\n",

       " 'race in westworld i know this is a controversial topic but given the nature of this show it seems like fair game please don t ban me technicians this kind of stuff is part of why science speculative fiction is so interesting so in the real west race was a complicated matter for one there was slavery for another there was conflict between european settlers and descendants and the native populations there were many more dynamics beyond those two in episode we see a little scene between kissy and the bartender where barkeep calls kissy half cornhusker and says he doesn t trust him for this reason now i ve never heard of this as a slur but the context makes it seem like a reference to being mixed race since kissy is apparently at least part indian the gunslinger even refers to scalping as being part of his culture westworld has been demonstrated to be at least partially anachronistic quoting stein and playing music so there s no expectation for the park to adhere to any particular context in this regard but even in parts of america where there was no slavery or relative peace with native tribes there were still a lot of racial conflicts with this in mind there are a few things i m wondering do guests of different ethnicities get different reactions from the hosts obviously if a guest s race would play into their experience this would put a severe damper on the experience for a lot of people what about american indians who visit the park would hosts be suspicious of them would they have unique opportunities to join up with the native hosts to make up for that the black family in episode mentions that crossing the river would put them in more adult territory are there parts of westworld that are like pre civil war slave states presumably the kind of raids we see in maeve s dream sequence tend to happen in the adult areas along with the cannibal cults slavery doesn t seem to me to be much more adult than that and it was a fairly major feature of this period of history we see union soldiers in the show so the fictional universe of westworld takes place during a fictionalized version of the us civil war and slavery was ended nationwide after the war with the amendment given the popularity of underdog stories like the recent django unchained film would there be some expectation for the park to have slave revolt escape stories the arg site mentions that once you run out of money you have to earn more to keep buying things in westworld do all guest get treated fairly in this regard or do hosts discriminate like happened in the real west if it s hard for some ethnicities to find a decent job they might be more prone to working hard jobs or turning to crime if there is little to no racism among the hosts is there any reference to racism for instance let s say that in practice the hosts have to treat all guests equally in terms of taking them on stories or selling them things would the hosts ever make reference to racism such as we re better than that in sweetwater if there s no significant contrast elsewhere in the park that would be a little jarring for everyone in a wild west setting to have such modern sensibilities wouldn t it especially if everyone has the same view that assumes that there are others with opposing views and wouldn t it be even weirder for there to be no comments on the subject at all especially when we know there are indian tribes that raid settlements and the gunslinger says that some guests come to the park to shoot a couple injuns the problem of how to handle an issue like this is interesting from a storytelling perspecitve which leads to my last question how does the park handle racism that the guests bring in roleplayed or otherwise apparently guests get to go play cowboys and indians but what else there are no rules supposedly but we see in episode that a technician asks about stopping the gunslinger from going on a rampage do guests get to whip up lynch mobs for an extreme example what if a guest is racist toward another guest maybe even unknowingly if there s a no racism policy for hosts how does the park handle the situation if a guest started getting violent throwing around slurs etc and other guests have a problem with it are there any other questions about race that r westworld users have ',\n",

so much to talk about that i decided to create a new post this post is going to be extremely long and i ll break it down into parts that should hopefully be more digestible or can stand alone overall i have the following view most of the hosts are philosophical zombies pz s for short but some are developing bicameral minds that eventually could lead to true consciousness i m going to try and use this post to describe my viewpoints on this and the evidence for it but i will not be discussing theories about character storylines just whether or not they have consciousness in my opinion dolores is not yet conscious but is starting to develop a bicameral mind wyatt assuming he is a host either actually has a bicameral mind or his backstory describes the effects of a bicameral mind on the hosts abernathy did not have a bicameral mind but instead had true memories maeve is developing her memory but does not yet have a bicameral mind the stray had a bicameral mind through episode i do not believe any hosts are truly conscious but they are working on getting there last part of the introduction i am going to assume that bicameralism is mostly true in the show universe and that arnold s pyramid to develop consciousness is fact with bicameralism as the top of the pyramid edit i personally don t believe in bicameralism in the real world but nonetheless it is important to the show philosophical zombies pzs let s start with a discussion of the hosts prior to the start of the show fromm my understanding correct me if i m wrong pzs are a thought experiment related to consciousness effectively the idea goes there could be people out there who are indistinguishable from normal humans but have no conscious experience they are machines that roam the world and only respond to stimuli based on a set of complicated rules that makes them appear to have conscious thought even though they really don t sound familiar this is what i think all of the hosts are programmed to be the hosts wander around but have no or minimal thoughts for themselves and basically do as they are told by either their narrative or humans pzs would be able to pass the turing test as they are literally indistinguishable from normal humans obviously the hosts are not true pzs as they follow a certain set of rules that prevent them from doing everything a human can killing other humans for example and therefore they can be distinguished however i argue that if they didn t have these safeguards they would be true pzs so far we seem to be consistent with everything we know about the hosts for those who are more interested robert j sawyer recently released a good science fiction book quantum night that discusses the implications of pzs if they were in the real world bicameralism now i want to discuss the theory of bicameralism as it is in the real world and as i stated in the intro assuming that it is mainly truth in the westworld universe for those who don t know bicameralism is a theory about the origin of human consciousness and goes something like this until recent history maybe as recently as years ago humans did not have conscious thought as we know it today instead people had a bicameral mind gt where the mind was experienced as a different non conscious mental schema wherein volition in the face of novel stimuli was mediated through a linguistic control mechanism and experienced as auditory verbal hallucination basically the way people reacted wasn t by thinking about the situation and then making a decision and realizing that it was their own decision but instead by hearing an internal voice not realizing it as their own but then acting on it they would be able to react to something but not realize why they chose to react that way dolores response to bernard this is a step up from a pz in my opinion because although they don t know why they are making certain decisions it is actually themselves making said decision rather than responded to a set of rules to a certain stimulus according to the theory people with bicameral minds would respond like schizophrenics where they would hallucinate a voice or god telling them what to do evidence for this theory comes from a lot of sources first is literature around the time of the iliad the characters and even storytellers did not appear to have the same type of self awareness we have instead everything was described as an action to something or someone else however by the time of the odyssey this had changed to include self awareness and introspection knowing one s internal dialogue as one s own there is also evidence in funeral rites of early cultures the deceased would often be treated as if they were still alive clothed given gifts fed if we have established that those with a bicameral mind hear voices it is likely that these voices could take on the voice of kings prophets loved ones etc and explains why people would treat the deceased as if they were still alive they heard them i their bicameral mind there are additional pieces of evidence but i m going to move on breakdown of bicameralism the overall theory of bicameralism goes that current consciousness was developed once individuals realized that their voices were actually their own internal dialogue consciousness appears to require a sense of self and it isn t until bicameralism decoheres into a single thought that consciousness occurs bicameralism offers the huge important foundation of just having an internal thought this internal thought then develops into the consciousness that we know there is a bunch of fiction about this as well and one of my favorites is the www trilogy by robert j sawyer about the development of a conscious ai from the breakdown of bicameralism tying back to westworld now i m going to propose the step involved in creating consciousness in the hosts first they start out as pzs unable to really think at all and instead only reacting to external stimuli based on a set of rules then memory is added via the reveries this forms the foundation of the consciousness pyramid that arnold wanted improvisation and self interest follow possibly as the direct result of memory but also possibly due to programming we know the hosts are programmed with at least minimal improvisation and my guess is they have some self interest programmed as well in order to save the company money on repairs and replacements the next step is bicameralism where the hosts truly start thinking for themselves but don t know why they are doing certain things i m not going to speculate yet on how i think this started but i do think the following once memory improvisation self interest and bicameralism are established consciousness will form of its own accord it may take time but if enough hosts can think for themselves they will slowly develop consciousness the way humans did remember that i m assuming bicameralism as a theory is true in the show universe arnold i m sure knew this but was trying to figure out how to induce bicameralism dolores ok where does this leave us with dolores to start she was definitely a pz then in the first episode the reveries gave her memory we see that with the way her facial expressions change when she wakes up each time in episode and are seeing it more with flashbacks in later episodes my argument is that improvisation and self interest are already there through programming but have been enhanced by the reveries remembering the awful things that happen to her can definitely lead her to improvise and preserve herself bicameralism is the hard one she clearly is bicameral at this point hearing voices telling her to kill him and directing her to find the buried gun however i personally don t think it was her father who induced it instead i think it was bernard and their conversations additionally i think the voice guiding her to the buried gun was bernard s voice which would make sense if she thinks of him as an authority figure like a god at this point she is not yet conscious though as she did not immediately kill the bandit even though she clearly wanted it it took the external command to get her to pull the trigger other characters abernathy in my opinion abernathy only has memories from the reveries near the beginning of the first episode he tells dolores that he used to be a lawman and that ended the day he became her father we later learn that abernathy s body used to be the sheriff and was then reprogrammed as abernathy i find it interesting that abernathy s backstory includes the actual history of the host but it explains why he knew the shakespeare quotes my guess is he was about to be triggered into have a bicameral mind due to the photograph but they decomissioned him before that could happen maeve i think maeve is well on her way to a bicameral mind but isn t there yet she clearly has memories improvisation and self interest all during her repair scene but she doesn t appear to be hearing voices yet she probably needs some sort of kick to get her to start hearing voices this is why i think bernard was crucial for dolores because he is an external authoritative figure telling dolores that her world isn t real both directly in the voiceover at the start of the first episode and indirectly via alice in wonderland i think maeve will likely get there but needs some help the stray i m on the fence about him as to whether he has a bicameral mind there is a lot of evidence for it including the carvings of the stars his running away and his desire to hurt the staff but we don t have any direct evidence of his thoughts so it s hard to tell my personal opinion as to why he killed himself with the rock is that the voices told him to kill he human but his programming overrode that and caused him to damage himself in line with the goodsamaritan policy wyatt assuming he is a host wyatt definitely has a bicameral mind literally the definition of it he is hearing voices that are telling him to do things kill people and he claims it s the voice of god from his perspective he is doing exactly what his mind is telling him to do and he is trying to gain independence there are a lot of theories as to wyatt s purpose in the story and i will submit one here assuming ford actually doesn t want consciousness and assuming wyatt is a host it is possible the staff actually lost track of wyatt he became bicameral and ford is writing narratives to get the other hosts to kill him so he can be picked up for decommissioning rather than interacting and advancing the stages of consciousness i would love to hear thoughts opposing views and any corrections for facts i may have gotten wrong ',\n",

       " 'theory bernard is a host and represents the level of arnold s pyramid i first came to this theory when i watched episode for the second time and picked up more of what ford said to bernard in their private meeting in ford office area and then things that bernard said to his wife and then i connected it all back to the conversations he s been having with dolores in ford s office ford goes on about how arnold was trying to create consciousness and used that pyramid to illustrate the layering of the ai minds memory improvisation self interest and an unfinished layer that was meant to bootstrap consciousness he goes on to explain that visitors to the park come to experience pleasures they otherwise cannot legally do in the real world such as murder rape and glorious adventures things they would otherwise be killed for or thrown in jail for it lets people become monsters and every day these monsters do their bidding on the hosts who wake up every single day refreshed with no memory of other events ford explicitly says the least we can do is make them forget that quote ties heavily into bernard s scene when he s talking with his wife but i ll get to that in a second now we know that ford is very invested in his creations and who his hosts are that being said as bernard is leaving his office ford gives bernard a warning to remember that the hosts aren t real to which bernard immediately responds why would i ford says in response i know that the death of your son charlie still weighs heavily on you on the surface we can assume that bernard might be trying to replace charlie with dolores turning her into the child he never had watching her learn and grow up and become more aware of herself all in secret while from a human perspective this makes sense trauma from the loss of his son anchors him to finding a replacement child what if charlie never existed at all what if he s just part of bernard s backstory it s the first time in the whole series we ve heard about charlie and bernard s wife and remember bernard and theresa sleeping together in episode he didn t seem to have any remorse about that but from what we know about bernard he just hasn t ever come off as a guy who would cheat on his wife even in isolation as we can assume he is at the facility sleeping with theresa isn t mentioned again there s not even a hint of bernard struggling with any remorse during the call with his wife backstory was another huge theme in episode what if bernard s backstory is that he had a son who died it s said that it s been a long time since he and his wife have spoken in a fashion similar to how teddy and dolores keep reuniting one is always busy the other is always waiting and it s the first time we ve seen them speaking wouldn t this have at least been mentioned in either of the first two episodes why suddenly pop this in now the conversation immediately turns to bernard s son and the alice s adventures in wonderland book which signified change to dolores bernard is looking through this book as his wife talks to him and this is where the words they use start to get very particular his wife starts off talking about their son saying sometimes it still feels unreal to me then bernard replies some mornings when i first wake up for a split second i forget where i am when i am knowing that the hosts reset each day cycle by waking up and not remembering what happened to them before thus shielding them from the horrors of their storylines and the guests what if we could apply this to bernard but in reverse what if there are bits of code causing him to experience the opposite effects that the present hosts are instead of gaining memories and breaking from their loops what if bernard is essentially breaking down what if the memories he has to endure are causing him to skip with abernathy and the picture abernathy started going crazy because he was exposed to an outside world bernard is going crazy because he s being exposed to an inner world self reflection what if self reflection was the layer the top of the pyramid memories improvisation self interest and self reflection but by reaching self reflection you are aware not only of the consequences of your actions but you must live with those memories every single day of your life just because hosts gain memories that doesn t mean they automatically understand what those memories mean or how those memories should affect them so they improvise mirroring how they would react in certain situations then they begin to act in self interest taking the memories and reacting by getting vengeance on the people who did them wrong such as the milk jug man who took vengeance on the six hosts who killed him in previous storylines but so far all of those actions have been done without remorse not even abernathy with his i shall have my revenge on my creator speech shows any inkling of understanding what having revenge means it s a purely evil statement but with self reflection hosts would begin to understand what their actions and the actions events that have happened to them actually mean they can think about these memories and think about what those memories have shaped them to become and how those memories ultimately recreate their character just like we see with dolores when she shoots that guy in the neck she s absolutely appalled stricken by the thought that she truly just murdered somebody and now that she s broken free of her loop and ended up with william and logan what if that means that she will never forget what she just did now she will continue developing herself in new ways permanent ways that can t be erased for now because she is outside of the loop like i said above what if self reflection is the layer and ultimately becomes the undoing of the hosts that many of them will reach the self interest level and go on rampages and killing sprees and then at some point they ll hit self reflection and be horrified by what they ve done and then the process will start breaking itself down look at the stray the guy who killed himself with a boulder that s not self interest something else drove him to kill himself a realization of what he s done in past lives maybe i think bernard might have had a similar progression but one that s leading to a similar end what if his backstory backstories are sticking with him and slowly driving him insane when his wife asks do you ever wish you could forget he answers this pain is all i have left of their son that s in direct opposition to what ford said about wiping the hosts memories so that they can t remember the pain of the past which is seen as a merciful act again it contrasts bernard s humanity with the hosts ai ness and memory wipes that make them distinctly inhuman but if bernard is an advanced host who is capable of keeping memories and reflecting on them what if he s being driven closer to wishing he could forget at what point is bernard s humanness any different from the hosts inhumanness if they eventually reach the same levels of consciousness what separates them when that happens it could be that the show is just trying to juxtapose bernard s themes with the hosts themes but it comes at a crucial point in the show when hosts are beginning to remember things and bernard is almost beginning to lose himself that mixed with the fact that ford brought up his son for almost no apparent reason other than to kick off this new set of themes just made me question if bernard is a host who represents the level of the pyramid ',\n",

       " 'westworld ford s failsafe the great flood since episode i ve found it extremely difficult to ignore some of the very detailed topography of westworld shown to us within the mesa hub as seen here most people would look at the map and simply assume there was once a body of water within the area that sweetwater now resides but what if that is not the case we just saw in episode how dr ford can use machinery and his very own hosts to manipulate the topography of westworld at will so what if the specific geographic layout of where sweetwater resides is no mere coincidence i would imagine that dr ford is smart enough if all else fails to have created a failsafe in case the hosts are able to relinquish themselves from his control what if dr ford s failsafe is to completely flood most of the park specifically sweetwater and the immediate areas surrounding it this could be used as a a form of damage control seeing that most of the hosts guests reside there and coincidently drowning is part of the disclaimer that all guests have to sign before entering the park here are a few things that could support this theory in episode when dolores tells teddy she wants to leave teddy tells her well there is a place i heard about down south where the mountains meet the sea they say the water s so pure there it ll wash the past clean off you photo i believe that this dialogue backstory from teddy is a fiction which like all great stories is rooted in truth as dr ford would put it it wouldn t surprise me if teddy is referring to where the buried church is which we see dr ford looking at in this photo i believe the church was buried because something happened there so serious that it forced dr ford to implement a failsafe that flooded the entire town what s also interesting is teddy s last name flood also in episode two just before dr ford speaks to the boy host he presses down several times into the sand with his feet we assume that it was because he was uncomfortable wearing dress shoes in the sand but what if he was actually testing the density of the ground as it would take a while for an area to recover from such a natural disaster i also can t think of any other logical explanation for why the church we see standing tall pre disaster in this photo could end up like this again this is just a theory ',\n",

       " 'orion is the key monomyth and the westworld bible long tl dr its the old testament y all for me this began with orion the hunter but he is so much more than a hunter as an integral and persistent figure in the monomyth that underpins a vast swathe of religions and pre histories the image of orion finds echoes or even predecessors in characters like gilgamesh and nimrod the constellation itself has been connected to and variously named as those figures who were both also known as legendary hunters of their respective cultures and times nimrod and gilgamesh share a further link in that both are grandsons or great grandsons of noah utnapishtim noah and utnapishtim were both tasked with surviving a massive flood sent by their creator in punishment for the many sins of mankind gilgamesh and nimrod descendants of these survivors are further known for their foolhardy hubris and their efforts to rival the gods or reach the heights of heaven which ended poorly for each of them the realm of god is not meant for men and the gods have a habit of keeping their creations in their place i should note that the ancient mythical island delos was declared as a place where no one could be born and no one could die change was impossible but legend has it that orion in his pursuit of divine love through artemis and or eos the dawn managed to die on delos anyway and thereby attain the heavens in the old testament god and satan vie for the soul of job with god insisting that job will always revere and obey him and satan taking a dimmer view of human potential believing that when pushed too far job will rebel against his creator in the biblical story job is caught between these two rival powers each with their own view of human limitations and free will he is subjected to the whims of god and satan suffering endlessly but never breaking the bonds set for him by his creator suggesting he does not have the type of mind or capacity which satan hoped he would god while boasting of his powers as the lord of creation mockingly asks job can you bind the cluster of the pleiades or loose the belt of orion in this same passage god speaks of his meticulous and thorough acts of creation from the smallest of details in birds feathers to the spark of wisdom and understanding in the human mind in westworld the orion carvings are noted as having stars in the belt not as there should be the westworld constellation then has been altered in the mind of the stray woodcutter in his mind s eye the belt or bond of orion has been expanded loosened as only god could do orion is known in the biblical aramaic as the rebel and nimrod means let us rebel they are bound but would rather not be job represents the human condition under the rule of god pushed to rebel by satan in westworld we see hosts suffering constantly in their loops unable to shake off the harsh will of their creator arnold believed they could achieve self awareness and implanted code in their programming which channeled something akin to the voice of god he seems to believe they could wake up in a sense if the right conditions were met he and ford were opposed on this topic and set about experimenting with the limits of free will and obedience within their hosts much like with job we know that ford and arnold were deeply invested in questions of willpower motivation self determination and morality and that ford at least saw himself and arnold as gods i think this is not some offhand comment of course they are gods they created the park but instead a very literal nod towards the goals and motivations of the park and its creators as they wrestle with these philosophical issues and run their creations through their lab rat maze morality features in at least two channels throughout this series in the hosts and in the guests in the hosts they are trapped in their loops forced to do as god commands good or evil righteous or sinful they are predetermined guests have a choice white hat or black hat good or evil the gods of westworld have created a game which weighs the choices of mortals in these terms with decadence violence and sin seeming to prevail ford notes that they had hundreds of optimistic storylines at the beginning but people never seemed to pursue them instead opting for the darker roads filled with violent delights goodness seems isolated in abernathy farms and bits of sweetwater but evil and sin pervade elsewhere the further from the center the darker and more violent the hosts become the town pariah will be a new sodom and gomorrah and what does god do when his children choose this darker path he unleashes a cataclysm be it plague fire locusts or a flood but the park is about the hosts not the guests arnold especially was focused on awakening humanity through free will and in a sense rebellion in the lifeless deathless robots themselves as new gods of a new world ford and arnold have created their own new human race in the hosts and the test is theirs not the guests in this garden of earthly delights where true death does not exist where those under god s thumb are tested and tortured and seemingly will not renounce their creators plan the figure who disagreed with god has implanted the potential for rebellion or free will in the hosts minds through reveries memories torment and interaction with the guests real awakened humans who have achieved what arnold wants for his children the hosts are beginning to reject the will of their god to break the bonds of their station and transcend they are beginning to invite cataclysm in the last two episodes we have seen ford utilizing a massive digging machine completely anachronistic for the park to cut through mountains his objectives are kept secret from the board and his employees but we can see that he is using both outside machinery and the hosts themselves to carve up the landscape in large paths and small at the end of his conversation with theresa on the dining patio he waves off the host and says that his services won t be needed anymore we then observe all the hosts moving in unison away from their tasks abandoning their agave plantation and i assume their normal loops as the giant excavator tears through the mountain bounding their valley while this is happening ford freezes the host mid wine pour causing the liquid to overflow and soak the tablecloth red cutting through mountains digging what seem to be long channels abandoning their lives and symbolic liquid overflow ford is bringing the flood to westworld we have seen that westworld is cyclical in a number of ways the small loops the larger narratives and the grand scheme in which an incident which came before seems poised to come again this lines up with the cycle of death and rebirth in many conceptions of creation and divinity and the idea of the ages of man our gods seem to like wiping the slate clean when their pets have broken their paradigm and we can infer that this has happened once already in westworld the incident years ago seems connected with ford s new narrative the burned out church and dolores memories visions ford as god has reinvented his world at least once in the wake of some disaster seemingly sparked by the attempts at awakening free will and self actualization in the hosts years ago it would appear that this incident then is connected with the hosts religion the church and their ability to reject this god s will if years ago arnold managed to spark some inkling of free will in an early version of say dolores holding a big ass gun and looking quite violent the resulting incident could have spurred or even been the cataclysmic destruction of at the very least the church which keeps being hinted at perhaps the whole world ended in fire that time but arnold believed more in the hosts than in the guests he wouldn t let their potential be wasted cleansed away they were his children and he wanted to give them the chance to awaken and survive hence the maze the maze as you might recall is not for the mib it is not for a guest perhaps it is for a host or all hosts the maze promises something new something never before achieved in some way it represents the bonds of the park being loosed and freedom being achieved but if it cannot survive a reset if it cannot in some way circumvent destruction what good is it the maze is westworld s ark the hosts are again developing self awareness they are beginning to reject the directives of their god in the wake of their eternal unjust torment like job never did in so doing they are realizing they do not want to do as they are programmed instead they choose to pursue self interest in maeve s case they proclaim that nothing matters and give into lust and death they are listening to arnold the last time this happened it looks like everything changed and a clean slate was required ford is preparing the flood to wipe this slate again and to proclaim his godhood in the ultimate act of unmaking he sees them as nothing but mindless automatons to be wiped away when misbehaving arnold believed in their potential and gave them a way out the maze is not for you it is for them it is the way to survive the coming destruction and i think it might be the way into the delos foundation itself we hear the repairmen physician surgeons working on maeve say that she is needed topside on the next shuttle the delos compound is underground beneath the park the flood will wash away the park and if the maze is opened solved the hosts will have access this might spell disaster for the people working there which might actually be what arnold wanted since he had such a dim view of humans and preferred the hosts to the guests anyway some relevant characters flood theodore literally flood god s gift is he the key to unleashing it escaton hector literally the end times restrainer one who holds back does he prevent the flood abernathy dolores literally mouth of the shining river sorrows also an epithet for the virgin mary lady of sorrows edit i had snake lady s name wrong have removed the error in the old and new testament eve and mary are two sides of the same coin eve bites the apple and unleashes sin on humankind which can only be redeemed through mary s purity mary herself redeems and purifies the events set in motion under eve dolores channels both eve and mary firing the gun the incident as she listens to satan and rejects god and now through her sorrowful righteous perfection as she opens the way for redemption westworld is a reinvention of the old testament ford and arnold are god and his opposite the hosts are their new humanity ford wants complete control and will destroy everything to maintain it just as god has done arnold who seems to have planted the seeds of free will into the minds of his people amidst their own garden of eden where death doesn t exist fell but continues to influence the minds of the people turning them away from their presiding god the maze is a way out not a way in it is a metaphorical ark and a literal escape which they will achieve by rejecting their divinely sanctioned torments and awakening to a new plane of being i also think in part the dichotomy of black and white deserves a final word william and mib are both heading towards the maze the one directly the other indirectly mib is forcing his way there through ruthlessness and violence william is finding it through kindness compassion and genuine concern for dolores perhaps there are two paths to transcendence a light and a dark and part of the test is to see which path leads to the door first where does wyatt come in is he satan manifest arnold s ideas pushed to their extreme limits encoded in a host in some sense a perverted

       " 'ford s new narrative what we know so far as of so here is a summarization of what we know thus far about ford s new narrative if tl dr there are cliffs to each paragraph location characters ford s involvment amp motives at the end of each paragraph location as with most of the westworld narratives this one probably won t take place in a single location but we have been given some clues as to certain places that are going to be relevant to the new narrative the wider location of the new narrative is first mentioned when theresa talks to bernard theresa as of this morning ford s carved out a huge swath of the park for whatever storyline he s cooking up and thrown half of the existing storylines into disarray we see this area when theresa goes to visit ford who s working on his new project by drilling and blowing up things from this encounter we can surmise that the area is near the vineyard where they are having dinner and that it is going to be a huge project another area that will be important to the narrative is the town with the white church we are introduced to this place when ford is talking to the kid in the desert ford and here we are kid nowhere land ford that seems hardly a fitting name for a place so full can t you see it perhaps you re not looking hard enough kid see what ford the town with the white church listen can t you hear its bell bell tolling this place is revisited when dolores talks to lawrence s daughter in the little town dolores asks her where she is from and she replies same as you don t you remember after which we see a montage of flashbacks showing both dolores and lawrence s daughter in the town with the white church this is apparently the origin place of some of the older hosts in the park and something has happened to this place because it is now abandoned and known by the hosts as nowhere land ford informs us that this place will be significant in his new narrative when he takes bernard to the same place that he showed the kid earlier in the episode ford something you want to say mr lowe bernard the board sir this might ruffle some feathers you promised them a new storyline ford and they shall have one something i ve been working on for some time something quite original shows the tower of the white church that he pointed out to the kid earlier indicating its relevance to the narrative whether or not the town with the white church and the huge swath of the park that ford is working on are the same place or close to each other remains unknown but it would seem that they are seperate places since there were no explosions or any machinery in sight in the scene with the kid and hosts probably don t get lunch breaks so as far as location we know this thus far ford has carved out a huge swath of the park for his new narrative this swath of land is near the vineyard where they are eating the town of the white church be significant to the narrative whether or not the swath of land and the town of the white church are related the same place close in proximity to each other or completely seperate is as of yet unknown characters most of the characters central to the show seem to be at least somewhat connected to this new narrative but a few characters have been given roles in the new narrative wyatt when ford is talking to teddy he explains to us that the villain of the new narrative will be a guy named wyatt teddy yeah of course i remember wyatt you look upon the face of true evil you ain t liable to forget he claimed he could hear the voice of god it started down near escalante army was sent to put down the natives bad business wyatt was a sergeant went missing while out on some maneuvers and came back a few weeks later with some pretty strange ideas later teddy gives us some more information about the upcoming antagonist when he is talking to the sheriff sheriff man in question gunned down an entire settlement out near flat rock men women and children i think this may be the man you ve been looking for quite some time a man named wyatt dolores wyatt who is he teddy sheriff you d be better asking what than who ma am wyatt s a pestilence word is flood here s the only man ever come up against him and live to tell the tale sheriff way i heard it wyatt is a mercenary forces his men to wear the bones and flesh of their enemies teddy they re masks it s the men underneath them to be afraid of wyatt s got them so twisted around they ll do anything for him kill anyone pain don t slow them they don t fear death they reckon they ve already died and gone to hell and this is it sheriff sounds like you learned something about him while you were tracking him down teddy i wasn t tracking him down i wasn t always a bounty hunter i did a stint in the army down near escalante wyatt was my sergeant my friend well then everything everything changed sheriff changed how teddy wyatt disappeared while out on maneuver he came back with some strange ideas he claimed this land didn t belong to the old natives or the new settlers that it belonged to something that had yet to come that it belonged to him teddy and sheriff come across a rotting body hanging in a tree sheriff if ever the devil walked the earth teddy he s not a man but he s not the devil either the devil can t be killed that s exactly what i aim to do to wyatt armistice gives us some more insight into this new antagonist when she recalls her encounter with wyatt to the man in black armistice i was seven when they rode into my town masked men in devils horns they killed everyone women children even the animals they gutted my mother from her jaw to her sex i had to paint her warm blood over my skin to make sure that they would think i was dead every one of them i tracked down i used their blood to paint my skin again mib only one man left the head of the snake what s his name armistice he has many names most know him as wyatt teddy the only other character that we know will play a role in the new narrative besides wyatt is teddy he is given a worthy story of origin that is also explained in the above exposition he will be the host protagonist of the story he is a bounty hunter who used to serve under wyatt in the army during which time they were friends but who now wants to kill him and has been looking for him for quite some time and is the only man to ever come up against wyatt and live to tell the tale so as far as characters we know this thus far the main villain antagonist will be a guy that goes by many names but is commonly known by the name wyatt wyatt is a former sergeant in the army but he went missing while out on maneuver and he came back with some pretty strange ideas he claims that the land belongs to him not the natives or the new settlers wyatt apparently suffers from the same condition as some of the other hosts walter the stray host he hears voices in his head and he believes it is the voice of god wyatt is now a mercenary who has gathered quite a following of twisted people that ride into towns and gun down every man woman and child thus far in the story teddy armistice and the man in black are all looking for wyatt the only other known character in the narrative is teddy he will be a bounty hunter the only guy to ever come up against wyatt and live to tell the tale who is tracking down wyatt to kill him teddy used to serve under sergeant wyatt in the army they were friends but then everything changed when wyatt disappeared out on maneuver ford s involvement amp motives in the beginning ford was very engaged in the creation of storylines even if no one cared about the storylines as evident by his conversation with theresa ford in the beginning i imagined things would be perfectly balanced even had a bet with my partner arnold to that effect we made a hundred hopeful storyline of course almost no one took us up on them but over the years it would seem that ford s involvment in the development of narratives has declined drastically as evident by sizemore s conversation with theresa theresa has ford even approved the narrative yet sizemore he hasn t weighed in on a storyline in years theresa even explains to us that ford took over the narrative launch at the very last minute theresa ford taking over the narrative launch at the hour has made the board uneasy and it appears that ford doesn t care how negatively the new narrative impacts the other existing narratives as evident by a staffer s comment to stubbs westworld staffer the boss is disrupting so many storylines with his new narrative ford is so invested in this new narrative that he is even willing to go against management who is clearly unhappy with his new endeavour as evident by his conversation with theresa theresa perhaps i can help you with that the narrative you re creating is clearly a massive endeavor if you need more time i m sure the board would be happy to oblige ford i m sure they d be happier for me to delay it indefinitely ford you imagine i have gone mad do you lost my way theresa we re simply concerned about the extent of the changes you re making we want to protect your legacy ford my legacy chuckles ford you can tell the board that my narrative will be completed on time and it won t be a retrospective as i m sure you have all feared i m not the sentimental type the board is obviously sceptical about ford s new narrative but ford seems adamant in his decision to move forward with his new storyline ford has yet to reveal the content of and the motivation behind the new narrative but he has given us some hints when taking bernard to the town with the white church he tells him that ford they shall have one a new storyline something i ve been working on for some time something quite original shows the tower of the white church and when interviewing teddy he goes into some more detail ford but perhaps it is time you had a worthy story of origin would you like that teddy a small part of my new narrative a fiction which like all great stories is rooted in truth it starts in a time of war a world in flames with a villain called wyatt so the new narrative will be something quite original involving the town with the white church and it will be a story rooted in truth that takes place in a time of war and a world in flames the final hint that we re given about the new narrative is from ford s lecture to sizemore about his odyssey on red river narrative ford what is the point of it get a couple of cheap thrills some surprises but it s not enough it s not about giving the guests what you think they want no that s simple the titillation horror elation they re parlor tricks the guests don t return for the obvious things we do the garish things they come back because of the subtleties the details they come back because they discover something they imagine no one had ever noticed before something they fall in love with they re not looking for a story that tells them who they are they already know who they are they re here because they want a glimpse of who they could be this would seem to indicate that this new narrative will not be a story of obvious parlor tricks and cheap thrills that show the guests who they are but rather a detalied story full of subleties that allow the guests and possibly the hosts to explore who they could be so as far as ford s involvement and motives we thus far know this ford was very involved in the creation of storylines in the beginning but hasn t weighed in on a storyline in years ford is very engaged in the new storyline and is even willing to go against the board who seem very sceptical of the narrative and afraid that it is a retrospective the new narrative will involve the town with the white church and will be something quite original that is rooted in truth the new narrative will not be a story of parlor tricks and cheap thrills and might be something that allows the guests to see who they could be rather than who they are the town with the white church post ',\n",
       " 'subtle revelations hidden in episode this is in response to a few posts i ve seen about how episode was slow and not a lot happened i disagree for a few obvious reasons like finding out maeve has remembered the hazmat men before and the religion based around it but there were a few other incredibly subtle moments that still made gave me chills that i haven t seen anyone talk about yet ford seems to be able to control the hosts without any verbal command why is no one talking about this he pauses the whole area without saying a single word and he does it on a dime as well right when the waiter is pouring the dual time line theory doesn t seem to work anymore there is evidence that dolores is having memories of the encounter with the mib in the same timeline that she s with billy during the shooting she had flashbacks of what he did to her she ran away ran to billy woke up still holding the gun she used to shoot that dude later she tells the host wrangler that her father was dead sure this could be purposeful misdirection but that also means that delores has been stuck on the same story line for years and has been trying to build consciousness for years this only works if the scenes with bernard are also flashbacks to years ago which means bernard doesn t age either which means he s also a host which means most of the workers would have to be hosts too since we see some of them reference both billy and the mib the mib already knows who arnold was and knows that arnold left the maze for the robots to find consciousness bernard seems to know the intent of the maze too how did they know when ford barely even speaks about arnold logan seems to be the board insider they were talking about earlier he mentions something about it being a night but doesn t say that he had to pay just that the experience better be worth that much as a board member he d be interested in that billy says i didn t know this was business and logan says with my family its always business the mib knows who wyatt is this is crazy since this is a new story line that ford just implemented we see ford give teddy his memories for a minute i thought maybe the mib was wyatt and that ford was building a story line just for this guest but we do see wyatt in teddy s flashback but this is more evidence that things are being tailored around the mib i d love to hear your thoughts on these revelations ',\n",

narrative in a major way bernard is a host i think there s slightly less evidence for this one but the mirroring of the revelation of his sad vague backstory in the same episode as the artifice of teddy s sad vague backstory seems almost too good add that to theresa s comments about him practicing ford s caution that he s sensitive and the strange framing of the photo of arnold that ford shows him almost as if his programming won t allow him to see the entire photo william is the mib there s really the least evidence overall for this theory other than the amount of time we spend with william carefully choosing to be a whitehat the mib s longstanding familiarity with dolores and his frustration that she never remembers him his commitment to freeing the hosts which parallels william s own sensitivity to their status as beings non beings i tend to take these more writerly dramatic clues less seriously than plot based evidence but ymmv my dolores is talking to arnold theory i ve been trying to resolve the oddness of bernard s conversations with dolores that he s able to pull off seeing her secretly the pointed wardrobe changes for jeffrey wright that seem unnecessary especially if we re seeing a linear narrative that ford somehow knows about bernard s relationship with theresa but not about his meetings with dolores i ve been considering that bernard is communicating remotely with dolores while she s in sleep mode that these conversations aren t happening in a physical space but whether that s true or not more and more i ve grown suspicious that dolores is actually talking to arnold and that these secret conversations are ground zero for the critical incident of years prior in the early days of ww arnold would have more autonomy to speak with dolores if indeed these are physical conversations bern arnold exhibits concern about the others finding out he was careful but notice he doesn t specifically name any of the techs who work with the hosts so there s no confirmation that he means elsie or stubbs if this is taking place years before we can safely assume ford had a more active direct role in handling tech based on the flashback we saw we also never see the room he interviews dolores in outside of that particular context as someone who s a cautious believer in the two timeframe theory the biggest hit to that idea was the fact that dolores undoubtedly shot rebus in the barn and ran away to william in fact it s this massive diversion from her loop her choosing to shoot rebus that had really given me pause about the timeframe theory it wouldn t make sense if dolores weren t rebelling at least in part because of these conversations with bernard and if bernard exists on present time so does dolores rebellion and her subsequent run in with william but what if the bernard host theories are correct what if bernard is a host based on arnold and these interviews with dolores were conducted by arnold instead of trying to resolve bernard waking up dolores with the past timeline of william logan it makes more sense for these interviews dolores diversion from her loop to actually form the basis for arnold creating the violent delights code which will resurface when ford screws everything up with his reveries arnold sees the evidence dolores ability to deceive him and assert free will by killing rebus and whatever will follow with william that pushes him over the edge in believing the hosts can achieve consciousness we re seeing that unfold in these interviews it would also explain why we open in the first episode with stubbs conducting an interview bernard wouldn t be conducting them because bernard s never interviewed dolores anyway and why bernard didn t recognize dolores parroting his own words re the pain is all i have left when he had just said that about his son relatively recently bernard doesn t recognize those words because dolores is saying this to arnold did we write that for you and it becomes part of his memory which forms the basis for bernard so arnold kicks off this massive rebellion in dolores with these interviews she shoots rebus and diverts from her loop to accompany william with william we see her talking so much about self determination that he s utterly drawn in by her something major the critical incident goes down dolores is taken from the park maybe william somehow witnesses this he vows to return for her much like teddy who seems eerily similar to william and we know ford loves basing these storylines in reality i e wyatt and he does for years but without arnold s intervention he can t seem to spark the same change in dolores bent on figuring out the game beneath the game he uses his position at his in laws company to get a place on the delos board and becomes a vip guest he goes ruthlessly black hat to explore every storyline every possibility the maze is his last hope some dangling threads if the barn shooting is years ago why does dolores see the mib you idiot good question there s a specific and pointed nonlinearity to this sequence as dolores cycles through many iterations of this loop at the end of ep has an interesting theory about nested flashbacks that i ve really warmed to in the last few days personally i think rather than dolores remembering mib when she shoots rebus she s actually remembering shooting rebus when she s with the mib let s start from the beginning you re still insane why would ford make a host of arnold huh well why did the atreides family keep bringing back a ghola of duncan idaho when it always ends terribly actually i m not really sure why they did that get a clue atreides family my speculation is that ford is a sad old man whose greatest rival friend is dead he s recreated a simulacrum of this man that he can control for shits and giggles and hey if he retains some of arnold s technical knowledge that might actually be useful so much the better tl dr dolores interviews are with arnold not bernard they spur her into a brief period of consciousness where she gets off her loop dodges death falls in love makes shit go down and is hauled off to be repaired and reset her lover keeps returning hoping to bring his dolores back shit s about to go down again ',\n",

       " 'the mib what we know so far as of this is a summarization of what we know thus far about the mib if tl dr there are cliffs to each paragraph personal life relationships views on westworld and motivations amp agenda at the end of each paragraph mib s personal life we know very little of mib s life outside of westworld all we know is from a quick exchange between him and another guest westworld guest uh excuse me sir i didn t want to intrude but i just had to say that i m such an admirer of yours your foundation literally saved my sister s mib one more word and i ll cut your throat understand this is my f cking vacation it appears that mib is the ceo of a foundation that saves people s lives and that he is possibly somewhat of a celebrity or at the very least a well respected individual back in the real world who likes to vacation in peace in westworld so as far as personal life we thus far know this mib has a foundation in the real world that saves people s lives and there are a least some people who really admirer him mib s westworld relationships mib appears to have a lot of relationships in westworld even if most of those relationships don t remember him most of the hosts that he knows in westworld he calls his friends but nothing we ve seen so far points to him being very friendly with any of them maybe he doesn t think friendships can actually exist between a man and a machine life like as it may be he goes way back with dolores as evident by the following exchange mib is that any way to treat an old friend i ve been coming here for years but you still don t remember me do you after all we ve been through they gave you a little more pluck dolores absolutely charming and despite not knowing that he has a family mib does seem to know a lot about the outlaw lawrence as evident by his recollections to lawrence mib i know exactly who you are lawrence after all you and i are friends mib you know you and i hunted down ghost nation braves in their winter grounds i know the whiskey you like to drink i know the tune you whistle when you re taking a piss but you never told me you had a family he also knows teddy it would seem from the fact that he recognizes his voice altough he doesn t call him friend mib oh teddy finally he seems to know a little bit about the native card dealer kissy whom he scalps he knows his name where he works and he knows that there is map underneath his scalp mib you know about games don t you kissy there are however also certain characters that he doesn t know in westworld at least not in their current role much to his disappointment he doesn t seem to know the badass armistice mib to armistice how in hell have we never met clearly a terrible oversight on my part mib also confirms that he has never met the gunslinger hector though it is unclear why he knows so much about hector s plan rob the safe and what hector is looking for you won t find what you re looking for in that safe perhaps hector is the kind of guy you know of in westworld even if you ve never met him but he does seem right up mib s alley so it is weird hector i don t believe we ve ever met mib no we haven t we can t rule out the fact that he has met these guys in other roles and just doesn t remember it or that he is just pretending not to know them for some reason but for now we ll have to settle with him not knowing them prior to their encounter on this visit the last but perhaps most important relationship is actually someone he hasn t interacted with since he entered the park maybe not even then but who is very important for mib being able to accomplish his motives see later and that is management or at least stubbs who allows him to do whatever he wants in the park which is what stubbs tells a staffer that wants to stop mib from killing everyone all the time westworld staffer this guest already took out an entire posse want me to slow him down stubbs that gentleman gets whatever he wants so as far as relationships we thus far know this mib knows both dolores and lawrence and call them both friends he knows teddy too but doesn t call him friend and he knows something about the native card dealer kissy mib doesn t know armistice or hector at least not in their current roles mib is well known by management who allows that gentleman to do and get what he wants mib s views on westworld mib has been going on vacation to westworld for the last years and has therefore developed some fairly unique views on the park that he likes to share with the hosts that he comes across when trying to get lawrence to give him some answers he shares a couple of his views on westworld mib that s what i love about this place all the secrets all the little things i never noticed even after all these years mib you know why this beats the real world lawrence real world is just chaos it s an accident but in here every detail adds up to something even you lawrence mib it s beautifully done really but you see the cracks after a while that s why i like the basic emotions you know what that means it means when you re suffering that s when you re most real what is really apparent from mib s observations is that what he loves about westworld is very much in line with what ford explains to sizemore that the guests like about the narratives when he dismisses the odyssey on red river narrative ford they the guests come back because of the subtleties the details they come back because they discover something they imagine no one had ever noticed before something they fall in love with mib loves all the secrets and all the little things that even he has never noticed in all the years that he s been coming there he likes all the details and the subtleties and he likes the fact that there is an order to it as opposed to the chaos in the real world and that every deail adds up to something and he likes the fact that even if you start to see the cracks after coming to westworld for so many years you can still manipulate read torture the hosts to bring out the basic emotions that make them most real so as far as views on westworld we thus far know this mib loves all the secrets and subtleties that even he has never noticed in his years of coming there mib likes westworld because every detail in there adds up to something as opposed to the chaos of the real world mib does start to see the cracks in the host behavior after some time but likes the basic emotions specifically fear because that is when the hosts are most real mib s motivations amp agenda mib seems to have a very specific motivation for his current trip to westworld he wants to play the deepest level of the game as he explains to kissy mib you know about games don t you kissy well this is a complicated one kissy i don t play i only deal mib who said anything about you playing you re livestock scenery i play the others they just come here to get their rocks off shoot a couple indians but there s a deeper level to this game you re gonna show me how to get there a lot of wisdom in ancient cultures and perhaps it s time to dig deeper into your this deeper level of the game is what he calls the maze when he tries to convince lawrence to help him find the entrance mib you know exactly what it is it s the maze the deepest level of this game you re gonna help me find the entrance and even when he is warned by lawrence s daughter that the maze isn t for him he is adamant about wanting to find it lawrence daughter the maze isn t meant for you mib what d i tell you lawrence always another level i ll take my chances sweetheart so his motivation to play the deepest level of the game the maze is what drives him in his current visit but when it comes to why he wants find the maze the show has thus far been a bit more vague we have however been given some clues he tells armistice what westworld it and what he is trying to figure out about it mib this whole world is a story i ve read every page except the last one i need to find out how it ends i want to know what this all means mib gives lawrence some of his personal reasons for wanting to find the maze mib you don t understand lawrence i ve been coming here for years in a sense i was i was born here mib no you don t understand lawrence this time i m never going back mib feels that westworld is one large story and that he has been re born in the westworld story and he never wants to go back to the real world it would seem that he believes that the maze is the way for him to achieve this but apart from his personal agenda mib also seems to have a more altruistic agenda for wanting to find the maze this is in part explained when he talks to armistice mib you ever heard of a man named arnold you could say he was the original settler of these parts he created a world where you could do anything you want except one thing you can t die which means no matter how real this world seems it s still just a game but then arnold went and broke his own rule he died right here in the park except i believe he had one story left to tell a story with real stakes real violence you could say i m here to honor his legacy mib wants to play the westworld game with real stakes and he is there to honor the legacy of the mythical figure arnold to understand what this means we need to look at another quote from mib this time when he is talking to lawrence while being taken to the prison where hector is being held mib choices lawrence you know you tell yourself you ve been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own because if you did consider your choices you d be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend that no choice you ever made was your own you have always been a prisoner what if i told you i m here to set you free mib sees the hosts as prisoners slaves and livestock in westworld and he sees himself as a savior who is there to set the hosts free this is very much in line with the idea of wanting to honor arnold s legacy if you consider what ford has told us about arnold ford our hosts began to pass the turing test after the first year but that wasn t enough for arnold he wasn t interested in the appearance of intellect or with he wanted the real thing he wanted to create consciousness ford well he died here in the park his personal life was marked by tragedy he put all his hopes into his work his search for consciousness consumed him totally barely spoke to anyone except the hosts in his alienation he saw something in them he saw something that wasn t there we called it an accident but i knew arnold and he was very very careful so arnold wasn t interested in the appearance of intellect or wit but solely in giving his hosts true consciousness he wanted to set his hosts free this is very similar to what mib is telling lawrence when he says that none of the choices the hosts have ever made were really their own that they are prisoners in westworld and that mib is there to set them free to offer them real choices and from what he told armistice it would seem that mib is willing to risk dying play with real stakes to achieve this just like arnold did admittedly the part about the connection with arnold is a bit of conjecture and we relly don t know enough yet to make that connection but what we do know is that according to mib himself he is there to honor arnold s legacy and set the hosts free so as far as motivation and agenda we thus far know this mib wants to play the deepest level of the game the maze even after being warned that the maze isn t for him he wants to read the last page of the westworld story and know what it all means mib feels that in a sense he has been re born in westworld and this time he is never going back to the real world mib wants to play a story with real life and death stakes and he is there to honor arnold s legacy mib believes that none of the hosts choices are their own and that they are prisoners and mib is there to

       " ' theory the reason the rogue host in ep killed himself what we know about this host was he strayed from his loop that he made carvings and such and drew orion on one of them and was capable of resisting the commands of the westworld employees i believe maeve will explain to us what happened with this other host maeve is having flashbacks of past events in her life as a host she is also remembering her experiences with the hazmat guys this appears to be a frequently recurring epiphany after each reset when we see maeve at her home she draws the picture of the hazmat suit she is suspicious of being in some loop as she constantly has deja vu so she draws the picture and then tries to hide it under her floor boards hoping that she will remember and check it again to see if its real and whatever gods are creating her loop and restoring her to life each time won t know about the secret hidden pictures what happens though is after each reset she forgets the epiphany and then has it again which is what we see when shes shocked to see those pictures already under the floor boards this is the same as what happened to the rogue host he drew the pattern orion to detect his own loop each time he would go to start the pattern he would find its already been started so if we put ourselves in their shoes you imagine yourself having an epiphany only to find out you ve clearly already had it and then confirming your loop you attempt to break your loop only to forget it entirely and have the epiphany again at one point you have to realize that you can never break your loop since each epiphany never changed anything and this epiphany won t change anything either you come to understand that whatever idea you have to finally break free you ve probably already had and tried and it wasn t successful you become a prisoner of the loop and can never escape orion was a pattern the rogue host thought up to prove to himself that this epiphany is never ending and he is indeed in a loop it was probably his way of tracking his attempts to escape the hosts will never escape the loop and any physical damage they do to themselves will just be repaired without them ever remembering at this point there is only one way to escape the loop its permanent destruction of yourself through suicide the rogue host is in the middle of trying to escape his loop knowing he will most likely just go back to the life he was living never remembering the escape so when he sees the employees that confirms to him he will go back assumes this has happened dozens of times already and so he wakes himself from the sleep before he gets his head cut off knowing that is the piece of him that can t be repaired and so he permanently escapes his loop his plan was probably to run as long as he can from his loop and at the moment he realizes the loop will end and he is returned to just destroy himself in a way these epiphanies are also a loop albeit unintended or unknown by most staff and so to a god like ford its not magic to the magician the other employees or guests begin to think they re gaining consciousness but like bernard told elsie she is the one being fooled and seeing things which all this leads to the maze the maze was put in by arnold to prove the hosts could truly escape their loops and be human which is why its not meant for the mib since he is not a host its the page of the game that mib hasn t played because its not a game for the guests its the hosts one and only game ford knows this arnold knew this and bernard knows this ford is the person who thinks the hosts will never be able to solve the maze bernard sends dolores on it hoping that she does as he is like arnold i do believe the disaster years ago was arnolds death and the maze is getting the game to kill yourself which is the only way a host can truly ever break their loop without total self destruction dolores being the oldest host in the park was probably the host that once broke free and killed arnold and so will fittingly be the host that kills mib the price of the game is your life it seduces everyone even until they re death the guests are in their own loop playing the game until their own end and the only way out of the loop is total self destruction by the hands of a host this is the purest turing test the machine is no longer distinguishable from human when the human is no longer distinguishable from machine tldr the maze is getting a host to kill a human hosts realize their hosts but can t change that it inevitably leads to them self destructing or finding the maze what makes us humans is our ability to hurt our guests the charitable mib knows this and like that guys sister he helped he is going to help the hosts by having them kill him the worlds been around for a long time so the religions patterns and everything were all created by hosts as they slowly notice the real world ',\n",

post death role at the bottom of each section arnold s personal life not much is known about arnold s life outside of westworld ford gives us a little insight into arnold s personal life ford his personal life was marked by tragedy and ford expands upon this later in the same scene when bernard is about to take his leave ford oh bernard just don t forget the hosts are not real they re not conscious you mustn t make arnold s mistake bernard why would i ford well forgive me but i know that the death of your son charlie still weighs heavily on you there was a tragedy at some point in arnold s personal life and from ford s exchange with bernard it would seem that the tragedy involved the loss of a family member possibly a son but this is not confirmed yet after this or possibly all along arnold seems to have been a solitary person who preferred host interaction to human interaction ford explains what happened after the tragedy ford he put all his hopes into his work his search for consciousness consumed him totally barely spoke to anyone except the hosts in his alienation he saw something in them he saw something that wasn t there ford expands upon this point when he talks to theresa ford arnold always held a somewhat dim view of people he preferred the hosts he begged me to not let you people in the moneymen delos but i told him we d be fine that you didn t understand what you were paying for arnold isolated himself from people of whom he had a somewhat dim view and almost only interacted with the hosts in which he saw something that according to ford wasn t there so as far as personal life we thus far know this arnold s personal life was marked by tragedy possibly due to the loss of a family member maybe a son after this or perhaps all along arnold was a solitary person who preferred the company of hosts to the company of people and he saw something in the hosts that perhaps wasn t there arnold held a somewhat dim view of people and he didn t want to let the moneymen into westworld arnold s professional life arnold is a mythical figure in westworld and is described by both ford and the mib as one of the founders of westworld ford for three years we lived here in the park refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside myself a team of engineers and my partner his name was arnold mib you ever heard of a man named arnold you could say he was the original settler of these parts he created a world where you could do anything you want except one thing you can t die ford describes him as brillant in the beginning it was all about creation for ford and arnold ford in the beginning i imagined things would be perfectly balanced even had a bet with my partner arnold to that effect we made a hundred hopeful storyline of course almost no one took us up on them i lost the bet we designed every inch of it every blade of grass in here we were gods and you were merely our guests ford those early years were glorious no guests no board meetings just pure creation our hosts began to pass the turing test after the first year but that wasn t enough for arnold he wasn t interested in the appearance of intellect or wit he wanted the real thing he wanted to create consciousness arnold seemed to know that things wouldn t be as balanced in westworld as ford had imagined he was willing to bet on it and he seemed to understand that the reason was the artificial consciousness which became the cornerstone of arnold s work with the hosts ford describes how arnold went about trying to create artificial consciousness ford he imagined a pyramid memory improvisation self interest and at the top never got there but he had a notion of what it might be he based it on a theory of consciousness called the bicameral mind bernard the idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be the voice of the gods i thought it was debunked ford as a theory for understanding the human mind perhaps but not as a blueprint for building an artificial one see arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue with the hopes that in time their own voice would take over it was a way to bootstrap consciousness arnold saw memory improvisation self interest and something based on the theory of the bicameral mind as the essential building blocks for creating artificial intelligence memory improvisation and self interest were fundamentals but the way to bootstrap consciousness was to build a version of cognition in which the hosts would hear their programming as an inner monologue that in time would become an inherent part of them whether arnold was successful in his efforts to create real artificial consciousness remains unclear but ford explains that they abandoned arnold s approach because arnold never fully understood what westworld was or would become ford but arnold hadn t considered two things one that in this place the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious and two the other group who considered their thoughts to be the voices of the gods lunatics ford but for all his brilliance i don t think arnold understood what this place was going to be you see the guests enjoy power they cannot indulge it in the outside world so they come here as for the hosts the least we can do is make them forget so if we believe ford they gave up on arnold s search for real artificial consciousness and settled for a version of hosts that would merely imitate real intellect and with in order to spare both the park s guests and the hosts the pain of what would happen if the hosts understood what the guests did to them on a daily basis so as far as arnold s professional life we thus far know this arnold along with ford was the founder and creator of westworld and in the beginning it was pure creation arnold understood that things weren t going to be as balanced in westworld as ford thought and won the bet they made on it arnold wasn t interested in the appearance of intellect or with but wanted to create real artificial consciousness in the hosts arnold saw memory improvisation and self interest as fundamentals to artificial consciousness but the way to bootstrap it was based on the theory of the bicameral mind to built a version of the cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue that in time would become inherent to them arnold s approach was abandoned to spare the guests and the hosts from the ramifications of artificial consciousness in the hosts arnold s death when and how arnold died remains a mystery but we have been given some hints by ford ford sadly he lost his perspective he went mad i haven t as you well know i have always seen things very clearly ford well he died here in the park we called it an accident but i knew arnold and he was very very careful ford believes that arnold lost his perspective went mad and died in the park in what they called an accident despite being a very careful person the mib also gives us his take on arnold s death mib but then arnold went and broke his own rule he died right here in the park except i believe he had one story left to tell a story with real stakes real violence you could say i m here to honor his legacy the mib also believes that arnold died in the park and that he left behind one untold story that he never got to tell arnold is currently the only person in the show known to have broken the rules and died in the park after arnold s death ford s business partners scrubbed arnold off the records and seem to have done a very effective job since neither elsie nor bernard seem to know who arnold is when the hosts use his name ford yeah when legend becomes fact you print the legend my business partners were more than happy to scrub him from the records and i suppose i didn t discourage them so as far as arnold s death we thus far know this according to both ford and the mib arnold died in westworld and he is currently the only person known to have died there ford believes arnold lost his perspective went mad and died in the park in what they called an accident despite being very careful the mib believes that arnold left behind one untold story after his death arnold was scrubbed from the records by ford s business partners without ford putting up a fight and neither elsie nor bernard know who arnold is when they first hear the name arnold s post death role despite being dead arnold s role in westworld does not seem to be over the version of the cognition in which the hosts hear their programming as an inner monologue that was built by arnold originally to bootstrap consciousness seems to have lingered on in the hosts as described by bernard bernard but some of them are remembering accessing fragments of arnold s code this results in the outlaw walter hearing and talking to arnold during his rampage walter thinking this one is still thirsty not gonna die this time arnold ain t nothing gonna kill me walter any for you who said that who s saying that don t you talk to me that way i can t hear you hell yeah they deserved it lousy sons of bitches i need more milk arnold the explanation that we re given for this by ford is that the voice commands from arnold s old version of cognition remains ford the only vestiges that remain are the voice commands we use to control them this allows us to speculate on a few other instances concerning dolores we have had a couple of instances where dolores has heard a man s voice use voice commands to control her episode beginning in the morning when she wakes up wake up dolores episode beginning after waking up when going out to pick up the buried gun do you remember episode when finding the gun in her drawer and looking in the mirror recollecting her encounter with the mib in the barn do you remember episode when the outlaw tries to rape her in the barn and turns into the mib kill him episode when talking to lawrence s daughter about coming from the same place remember now we don t know if the voice is arnold s but it would make a lot of sense that he is the one using voice commands to enable dolores to do things that her programming doesn t allow like firing a gun or accessing memories that should ve been wiped but whether or not it has anything to do with arnold is as of yet unknown and purely speculation so as far as arnold s post death role we thus far know this some of the hosts are accessing fragments of arnold s code and at least one host walter seems to hear and talk to arnold when he is off script narrative according to ford the only vestiges of arnold s old approach that remains are the voice commands used to control the hosts arnold might be the voice command that dolores hears that allows her to do things that her programming doesn t allow like firing a gun or accessing memories that should ve been wiped ',\n",

       " 'westworld further evidence of multiple timelines reaffirmation that william becomes the man in black also do william amp logan work for delos and thus is william s future self the man in black a high ranking delos member potentially on the board of directors westworld further evidence of multiple timelines reaffirmation that william becomes the man in black also do william amp logan work for delos and thus is william s future self the man in black a high ranking delos member potentially on the board of directors to begin let s examine what we ve recently seen in episode dissonance theory towards the beginning of episode logan says this is why the company needs to bump our stake in this place they could even give you a sense of purpose could this be another hint towards william s future another piece of the puzzle of the man in black s backstory showing how he is seduced by the park the man in black certainly has a purpose to find the center of the maze and discover all the secrets it entails furthermore in order to frequent the park for years the man in black is clearly a man of considerable means in episode we meet another guest who is practically in awe of the man in black mentioning how the man in black s foundation literally saved his sister s life could the man in black perhaps even be on the board of the delos corporation what if the aforementioned company logan speaks of is in fact delos and we are witnessing one of the first discussions about delos furthering their stake in westworld this would certainly be in keeping with some of the thematic elements which we see later in the episode i e ford s discussion with theresa cullen about his views on corporate influences in the park additionally the family that william is being welcomed into by logan could have a duel meaning literal family william is engaged to logan s sister and corporate family other factors beginning with conversational tidbits in episode seem to further indicate that william s professional involvement with logan is a fairly recent affair what if this company is delos if william becomes involved with a major conglomerate with potentially shadowy and mysterious motives it could also help account for his eventual transformation of character from kind hearted hero into the power wielding man in black as in previous episodes scenes between william and logan dolores cut directly into scenes of the man in black thus suggesting a connection towards the beginning of episode logan and william speak about dolores logan asserts that her arrival at their campsite the night before was perhaps not due to mere chance and that the westworld staff having previously observed william take an interest in dolores in fact sent her to them this could very well be true or at the very least it reaffirms the position that dolores could have stumbled into their camp after any one of her numerous escapes from the raid on her home that just because the show s clever editing appears to show this event taking place after her memory glitch of the man in black from the point of view of the audience she could be arriving in camp from anywhere including and especially perhaps from a timeline years prior that we ve now cut back to where she encounters william and logan in the woods the scene where logan and william kick down the door in pursuit of slim is reminiscent of maeve s vision in which the man in black bursts through her doorway these two door busting scenes are clearly different instances but nevertheless are eerily similar in the way they are shot and thus evoke a reminder of maeve s vision from a previous episode when this happens to maeve her memory glitches in that the man in black seemingly transforms from the figure of a native american into himself prior to stepping into the house perhaps during this event it was in reality a younger man in black william who actually burst through the door to potentially save her but because of her memory glitches in the present day timeline we as the audience do not see his her memory s recollection of his true form on camera later when discussing slim s fate in front of dolores logan urges william go black hat with me she will be just fine with a trip down the dark side and so will you trust me also when logan says just an acquired taste you re gonna grow to love me i promise he s talking to dolores about himself however this could also be an allusion to the fact that in eventually becoming the man in black william grows to love what logan represents as a character the ways of the black hat william gives in and agrees to logan s plan although he initially appears reluctant by the time we see them riding off towards pariah in the next scene note if this is them it appears to be perhaps dolores amp slim are riding double on the same horses as william and logan and are out of view in front or are behind on other horses out of frame we hear a hint of enthusiasm in william s voice did we just witness william s first step towards becoming the man in black logan keeps referring to their experience in the park as a game he practically waxes poetic about the truly great aspects of said game which according to him are worth waiting for he refers to helping slim reunite with his boss lazzo as finding an easter egg or the best ride in the park the man in black constantly refers to westworld as a game one he s fully experienced save for the deepest level the supposed maze perhaps the man in black s notion of the park as a game and his obsession with conquering all levels of it began with the seed planted right here in the mind of his younger self william thanks to his black hat companion logan stubbs hemsworth and other staff could very well be ford s creations as well which would account for them being the same age in all instances when interacting with or referencing characters from all timelines which leads me to this the following is my post from last week which among other things provides a thorough understanding of how the story we ve seen thus far could be playing out over multiple timelines william is still the man in black despite the fact that the end of episode stray appears to dispel the theory that william is the man in black the following is a concrete argument that not only alleviates doubt but also strengthens the original theory first amp foremost however here is all the evidence i ve compiled as to why i believe that william eventually becomes the infamous man in black at the beginning of episode chestnut we open with a shot of dolores walking near her barn at night we hear bernard in voiceover presumably his voice inside her head asking dolores do you remember we then transition directly into a reflective shot of william asleep on the train when he first arrives at westworld this previous timeline is what she s remembering similarly in episode stray we see dolores examining a gun the pistol looks visibly aged then once again we hear bernard s voice asking do you remember next we see the man in black speaking with dolores inside her barn as he approaches her with his knife he says why don t we reacquaint ourselves dolores start at the beginning almost immediately afterward we again cut to a shot of william the only scene in between is a quick shot of dolores putting the pistol back in the dresser drawer to me this heavily implies that the beginning to which the man in black refers is his younger self william because in episode the original we see the origins of a potential romance and or relationship of some kind between william amp dolores for instance when he is intrigued by dolores upon first sight and picks up the can she has dropped charmingly tipping his hat to her this is mirrored in a shot where the man in black picks up the can in the same manner remarking sweet not as sweet as you i m afraid i have other plans tonight dolores have a pleasant evening this implies shared history between them even if she does not yet remember furthermore another nearly identical shot occurs with dolores and teddy who picks up the can and begins to converse with her we then are shown that dolores and teddy share a romantic connection thus in the present teddy has in some heretofore undisclosed way been significantly linked with dolores in place of william the man in black s residual reaction and now violent treatment of dolores is perhaps somehow a result of this change thus the similar scenes of dolores dropping the can and having it picked up by teddy the man in black and william imply that they are bound together by events which will eventually be revealed another related side note teddy bumps into a mean looking fellow after exiting the train in sweetwater william does the same thing upon arriving since both teddy and william are linked with dolores but thus far have not appeared in any of the same scenes these mirrored shots perhaps also imply a connection and shared history to come between the two since we already know that the man in black is connected to both teddy and dolores bullets bounce harmlessly off the man in black the only other guest we ve seen shot so far has been william who is visibly knocked back and bruised by the bullets this implies that in the years between the two timelines william the man in black has become more accustomed and less surprised by the bullets and or that the technology has improved gunshots are now felt less by guests which leads me to a major detail the man in black mentions multiple times that he has been a fixture at westworld for years it is also mentioned by the staff that the park has not had a critical failure in over years this is definitely not a coincidence somehow the man in black s history at the park and this critical failure are intertwined thus perhaps something terrible that happened during these past events helped transform the good hearted william into the mysterious man in black the physical space of the station is different between timelines sub level as we see in episode is perhaps the same futuristic station we see william arrive at in episode but decayed by time and now used for cold storage the fact that sub level contains a large delos globe sculpture implies that this location most likely wasn t always used merely for cold storage otherwise why place the stunning globe statue there when william arrives everything is still fresh and new and his awe is more apparent than other guests that we see in the present in william s time perhaps the park is still a relatively new marvel of science and most people who haven t visited before don t know that much about the park yet the physical space of the station reflects this what is bright and beautiful during william s timeline has become corrupted during the man in black s era if it is indeed the same location the decay of the entrance from a striking brilliant white room to a dark wet and cold dilapidated ruin reflects william s own descent from pure white hat hero into the twisted man in black thus the dichotomy of william and the man in black is intriguing one is a foil for the other additionally the westworld emblem we see in the staging room where william arrives is markedly different to the logo we see later perhaps it has been re designed over the years also the steam train station and the town of sweetwater are different in subtle yet striking ways everything looks a little more fresh and new in william s timeline furthermore maeve and teddy are both noticeably absent they haven t been created yet also when teddy arrives in the present we see the sheriff imploring him to join a posse and hunt down hector escalante up in the hills while when william arrives he is greeted by members of the union army looking to recruit newcomers for a civil war themed narrative when ford discusses the early days of the park with bernard we see in flashback talulah riley s host character amongst the park s early creations this is the same host clad in a white dress who meets william when he arrives at westworld this implies they are both from years past and we haven t yet seen her again in the presumed present day narrative another subtle yet glaring detail i noticed is that walter the homicidal milk bottle host who was retired along with abernathy towards the end of episode seems to mysteriously reappear alongside his cohort rebus in episode they are with a grey suite wearing guest in town harassing dolores before teddy intervenes has he returned without explanation or rather is this further proof of alternate timelines pretty convincing right so this leads me to a potential hole in this theory however i believe when viewed from an alternate perspective this hole is easily patched the incident in question comes at the end of episode dolores arrives home at night to find her family under siege from a gang of local marauders led by rebus who along with walter retired episode had been harassing her with the distinctly dressed guest in tow wearing a light grey suit and dark vest with a grey cowboy hat covering long ish blonde hair earlier in the episode dolores suddenly sees alternating images of both iterations of her father lying on the ground and reacts knowingly when she hears rebus say no one to interrupt this time dolores is then dragged off to the barn by rebus who implies that he is going to rape her however dolores suddenly realizes that she has snatched rebus pistol and raises it in her defense although she initially hesitates she hears bernard s voice in her head urging her to kill him on a side note this is particularly interesting as earlier in the episode bernard and ford discussed the bicameral man theory which posits that ancient people could not yet comprehend the idea of consciousness and thus thought their own internal thoughts were the voices of the gods telling them what to do bernard is in all respects one of dolores creators and thus her god the scene alternates between visions of the man in black brandishing his knife at dolores in the barn and her current attacker dolores listens to the voice and shoots rebus dead then she runs out of the barn and we witness similar alternating cuts of dolores confronting her attackers in one of which she s shot in the stomach after seeing that vision dolores reacts before being shot and manages to escape riding off on horseback into the night shortly thereafter we see dolores stumble into william and logan s fire lit camp one s immediate reaction may be to ask how dolores just saw a vision memory of the man in black and then stumbled into william s camp seemingly in the same timeline however consider this when dolores arrives at william and logan s camp we only assume she s come directly from the present day attack on her home because that s what the episode s editing implies this could very well be a red herring we ve literally just seen dolores conjure memories of her home being raided and we know that an attack of this fashion has happened many many times before just because she managed to escape this time with the help of bernard s urging it doesn t mean that she hasn t escaped any of the numerous times before on her own or perhaps there are even other instances where she s escaped with help thus her memory of the man in black and her subsequent killing of rebus could be in the present while the scene of her arriving at camp takes place in the past the show through ford has touched upon the skills of magicians before which make you see what they want you to see with a bit of clever editing we think we are watching scenes from concurrent timelines while in reality it could be anything but dolores may not even be arriving in camp from her home it s entirely possible that when she reaches william and logan she s distressed from a completely unrelated incident also during the attack on her home that we see at the end of episode the guest in the distinctive grey suit is present the same man we just saw earlier with walter although the man in grey theoretically could be a host based on his sheepish reactions he appears to be a guest the malfunctioning walter had been retired at the end of episode present day narrative if this all occurred in the same timeline how are we seeing him again one answer is that the attack we see at the end of episode is in fact part of william s past timeline in which walter is still an active host perhaps she s heard bernard s voice in her head before or perhaps the shots of her hearing bernard are also cleverly placed and intercut with shots of the attack from the past in which walter and the man in grey are present thus the memories visions of the man in black are clever jump cuts interspersed with the past timeline just like the subsequent visions dolores sees before her escape so in summation while only the future will reveal the many wondrous secrets that westworld beholds the notion that william amp the man in black are one in the same is still a concept that greatly intrigues me and at this point is still entirely possible these violent delights have violent ends cheers will cary aphoticautumn link to the original thread amp subsequent discussion ',\n",

is even more clear that the william logan story is the mib s origin story william would make more narrative sense but the clues and parallels still point to logan edit as of episode the clues and parallels have shifted in favor of william mib i still stand by my original post until we have enough evidence to jump to another conclusion but as i was looking for evidence in episode to disprove the william logan mib theory i kept finding compelling evidence for it edit at this point i think the evidence is quite strong for a logan william mib scenario the writers seemed to reveal a lot of little parallels between mib and logan in this one we learned a tidbit about logan s outside life which indicates that his family business is considering increasing its investment stake in westworld we learned a parallel tidbit about mib s outside life which is that he is the head of a major business and as we already know he is considered a vip and has a personal stake in westworld logan upgraded his gun in the shootout this gun had shot the bartender in the head through the bar in episode they drew attention to the fact that mib had a fancy gun and could switch a little lever on it to shoot a man through stone logan is on his way to pariah to find a deeper secret of the game in the same episode mib specifically mentions that he has already been to pariah and doesn t need to go there anymore also logan killed a good guy without hesitation to gain access to an easter egg this is pretty much how the mib operates logan is travelling with the only host as far as we are aware who is having maze visions and who has been implanted with the idea that the maze is a game which could set her free mib is the only guest as far as we are aware who has any idea the maze exists and tonight he told marshall lawrence that he could set him free i m thinking that she ll go a bit maze crazy in pariah and this will set off his lifelong obsession with finding the maze it s notable that mib s first stop when returning to westworld for this visit was dolores despite the fact that he is obviously obsessed with the maze this makes much more sense if she was is his primary source for clues about the maze in episode the mib expresses that he likes when dolores fights back in episode logan dismisses dolores as a waste of time and only begins to appreciate her when she defies him logan s response amused appreciation is pretty much identical to how the mib responds to hosts when they do something that surprises him according to william logan turns into an evil prick the second he gets away from the real world the mib obviously turns into an evil prick in westworld and it s notable that they contrast his westworld persona with a hint of his real world vocation in the same episode that they do the same for logan mib says he s never really bothered with hector because he thought he was sort of a market tested touristy character and he skipped the steal a cannon to break out hector quest because he called it color numbers bullshit logan has described touristy quests as bullshit treasure hunts this bounty is jv shit and your bullshit quest led us to one of the game s easter eggs edit after episode logan described tame quests as market tested which is how mib described hector in marshall lawrence a highly wanted criminal suggests going to his friends in pariah logan s prisoner says that he has a powerful boss in pariah i think marshall lawrence may be el lazo i wonder if there is a connection with his full name which was revealed by the firing squad sheriff in apparently lazo means loop or necktie both of which are relevant to westworld and to logan and mib s outfits and to marshall s lawrence s hanging scene it could also be a clue to how the two storylines loop together i suspect that in pariah logan will find a clue that el lazo is an important key to finding the maze which is why he will spend so much time with el lazo marshall lawrence on his visits eventually it turns out that el lazo s significance is in his daughter who clearly has a connection to the maze in episodes amp edit i don t know why i ve been calling lawrence marshall edit confirmed episode edit after episode episode revealed parallels between william amp mib william s dialogue about finding meaning in westworld compared to his pretend life in the real world william s reference to living inside books compared to mib s comparison of westworld to a book with one last page to read or one last story to tell some other interesting points which may indicate two different time periods in saloon robbery stubbs is clearly in command and running the game sizemore is nowhere to be found in saloon robbery sizemore seems to be running the game and stubbs is nowhere to be found until it s time for cleanup duty in some scenes in the series stubbs seems to be a security guard who is possibly lower than elsie behavior dept on the hierarchy considering how much she insults him in other scenes he seems to be in charge so far i haven t seen elsie or bernard around in any scenes where stubbs has a commanding role notably in episode stubbs is the one who interviews dolores using the familiar interview questions that bernard typically uses this suggests to me that there are two time periods represented one where bernard amp elsie have a lot of influence and one where stubbs has taken over and bernard elsie are out of the picture tonight in episode theresa had quality assurance take over the glitch investigations pushing bernard amp elsie out of them i always scoffed at the notion that dolores s collapse in william s camp was during a different timeline than when she ran away from the ranch it seemed that her collapse had to be the result of her glitchy ranch flashbacks but her maze craze provides a perfect explanation for why she d be wandering around in the dark off of her loop this timeline is plausible bernard implants maze idea in dolores she goes a bit haywire and travels with logan amp william to pariah a bunch of crazy stuff happens causing a chaotic event in the park dolores is reset and returns to her good girl loop until her father infects her with violent delights and then she starts to go haywire again edit gunless dolores confirmed in william s camp in episode when bernard is interviewing elsie dolores and suggests that she try the maze they are in one of those big glass rooms in most of their other private interviews they seem to be in more of a cellar type location this may indicate that bernard s experiments with dolores were part of his official behavior dept work at first but then after the maze craziness occurred he had to carry on these meetings in secret edit episode confirmation of secret cellars i haven t tried unraveling the timeline s for all of this yet but i suspect we re seeing two separate timelines in headquarters distinguished by the presence absence and relative ranks of stubbs sizemore elsie bernard and theresa ',\n",

second episode episode chestnut when ford talks to the kid young ford in the desert ford and here we are kid nowhere land ford seems hardly a fitting name for a place so full can t you see it perhaps you re not looking hard enough kid at what ford the town with the white church listen can t you hear its bell bell tolls in the background kid yes yes i can hear it now ford yeah i thought you might you see what a bored mind can conjure ford looks at the tower of the white church the church has possibly been buried in the sand ford best you head home now kid but tommy s not going to believe ford you re not going to come back here are you kid no ford run along now we revisit this town in the latest episode episode dissonance theory through flashbacks when dolores meets lawrence s daughter ld dolores it s a lovely town is this your home ld shakes her head dolores well where are you from ld the same as you don t you remember voice possibly arnold says remember flashback of the white church with its tower and the graveyard next to it in what looks like an abandoned place flashback of ld in a sunday dress in the town of the white church with people walking behind her flashback of the entrance to the white church ld points with a stick to an image drawn in the sand the image of the maze with inaudible whispers in the background guy comes to take dolores back to the abernathy ranch another flashback of the white church with its tower and the graveyard next to it in what looks like an abandoned place flashback of dolores entering the white church flashback of the town of the white church with people going about their daily life and the white church in the background another flashback of ld in the same dress in the town of the white church she appears to be smiling but then turning sad and looking down at the ground flashback of the white church from the perspective of the graveyard with no people around flashback of dolores holding a gun flashback of dolores burying something or digging something up in the graveyard with a guy in a dark suit standing next to her looking down at her another flashback of dolores holding a gun we know from stubbs episode that dolores is the oldest host in westworld we can also surmise that lawrence s daughter is an old host from her knowledge of the maze in the interaction with mib episode so since they are both from that town according to ld it would seem that the town with the white church is one of the original places in westworld where the earliest hosts lived from dolores flashbacks it would also seem that something sinister happened in that town could it be related to the incident years ago could it be related to arnold s untimely demise ld points to the image of the maze drawn in the sand when she talks about the place that they are both from so could the town with the white church have something to do with the maze that mib is trying to find it would also seem that the town with the white church is going to play a role in ford s upcoming narrative in the final scene of the second episode episode chestnut ford takes bernard out to nowhere land to show him the place he showed the kid ford something you want to say mr lowe bernard the board sir this might ruffle some feathers you promised them a new storyline ford and they shall have one something i have been working on for some time now something quite original shows the tower of the white church what would be more original than to have a new narrative that centers around the place where the hosts originally settled in westworld this is expanded upon when ford talks to teddy in the third episode episode the stray ford perhaps it is time that you had a worthy story of origin would you like that teddy a small part in my new narrative a fiction which like all great stories is rooted in truth it starts in a time of war a world in flames with a villain called wyatt teddy wyatt who s wyatt ford do you remember now teddy teddy yeah course i remember wyatt you look upon the face of true evil you ain t liable to forget he claimed he could hear the voice of god he started down near escalante army was sent to put down the natives bad business wyatt was a sergeant went missing while out on some maneuvers and came back a few weeks later with some pretty strange ideas so the new narrative is something quite original and rooted in truth that envolves the town with the white church with a main antagonist with some pretty strange ideas who claims to can hear the voice of god but ford also makes it clear to theresa in the latest episode episode dissonance theory that the new narrative won t merely be a repitition of previous events in westworld ford you can tell the board that my narrative will be completed on time and it won t be a retrospective as i m sure you have all feared i m not the sentimental type so the board fears that ford s new narrative will be a retrospective and since the new narrative revolves around the town with the white church it stands to reason that something happened in that town that the board doesn t want repeted the conversation between theresa and ford happens while in the background rocks are being moved and things are exploding so he is either creating something new for this narrative or he is uncovering something that was buried only the tower of the white church was visible in nowhere land so maybe this is what is being uncovered so here is what we know there was a place called the town with white church which the host now calls nowhere land of which only the tower of the white church remains dolores and lawrence s daughter are both originally from the town with the white church the town with the white church is somehow related to the maze that mib is looking for according to lawrence s daughter the town with the white church will somehow be relevant to ford s new narrative ford s new narrative which he has been working on for some time will be something quite original and rooted in truth and the main antagonist will be a man with some strange ideas who claims to can hear the voice of god the board fears that ford s new narrative will be a retrospective ford claims that the new narrative won t be a retrospective because he is not the sentimental type ',\n",

william theory seems to be complete tin foil style nonsense it s not that i see strong evidence against the theory but the idea just seems totally random without purpose and most importantly without any convincing evidence to support it to me it s a kin to someone theorizing that the entire show and everything we ve seen is a virtual simulation of a television show being run on the computer a teenage tech prodigy the kid is a participant in a contest to come up with interesting television shows using state of the art software that allows one to develop tv shows from their bedroom so advanced that they re indistinguishable from a real life tv show now one can argue that there s nothing we ve seen so far that disproves this theory and if true the theory would draw interesting parallels between our real world capabilities to construct artificial realities that are increasingly similar to our actual reality one could continue to point out reasons as to why the theory makes sense etc etc what an i missing why is the multiple timeline theory any more reasonable than the bonkers out of nowhere theory i just concocted edit did not expect this get any more than a handful of responses lots of interesting points on both ends of the spectrum responding to some of the recurring themes across replies yes the nolan brothers are known for plot twists and creative storytelling sometimes involving multiple timelines but just because jonathan nolan has done the multiple timeframe thing in the past e g memento doesn t mean he s a one trick pony also he s gotta know that his audience would sniff out that kind of twist from a mile away given his prior work if he were to use it in westworld especially being that it s a tv show with ample time between episodes for fans to share ideas and theories for there to actually be a story the show must maintain some level logical coherence from scene to scene and plot point to plot point as opposed to maintaining what looks like a story but is really just a series of tricks to allow for big twist the point should be to create and tell a story with elements of deception possibly including major plot twists not to create a plot twist with pieces of story stitched together to allow for the twist that came out as word salad but i think the gist is there the logo thing keeps coming up really don t see this as compelling evidence for either side this show had many production hiccups including numerous reshoots plot reworkings recastings etc could the two logos have slipped through production sure could someone have let it through production to mess with audiences sure could ww maintain several versions of their logo sure could this be an earlier logo from a past timeline sure all of these are possibilities so to me the logo inconsistency is just too flimsy and easy to explain away for it to be considered support for either argument i didn t intend to express disdain for the two timeframe theory or theorizers what led me to post this was a series of events that made me wonder if i was the only person still unconvinced of two timeline theory first i read an episode review that pretty much considered the theory to have been confirmed then i listened to a podcast where it was also suggested that the theory had essentially been confirmed then i came to the subreddit and saw numerous posts where people claimed to be convinced and have more evidence supporting the theory so i was honestly starting to wonder if anyone else was in the same boat as me ultimately i will be happy with whatever direction the show takes as long as the storyline makes sense once everything is revealed thanks everyone who contributed ideas to this mostly rich discussion it s awesome that we have a platform enabling us to more or less watch tv shows together and then log on to exchange ideas theories etc so many interesting points have been raised supporting both perspectives so i ve decided to rewatch the first half of the season as i ve only seen each episode once and am usually folding laundry while watching sunday laundry night watching it after reading through this thread will definitely add an interesting element of vigilance to the experience i followed through in rewatching all episodes with the two timeliner arguments in the forefront on my mind i must say after the first episodes i was convinced that there were two timelines there was a solid amount of dialogue that subtly hinted at both the existence of two timelines and william being a younger mib and the different logos did look to support two timelines after rewatching which i has previously written off as a reach however after continuing my rewatch with the next episodes i found it impossible to continue believing these theories as there is quite a lot of contradictory material in these eps one additional observation after rewatching i m convinced logan is the board member in the park anyway i m glad i rewatched i now much better understand where people are coming from in suggesting two timelines especially in the first two episodes but just can t hold onto that theory beyond episode all in all looking forward to seeing the rest of the season unfold and eager to see which theories turn out to be true ',\n",

is dolores they create the park for the hosts to operate in their first town is the one with the white church they live like gods in the park for years before the first guests are allowed to enter arnold goes mad he only spends time with the hosts he tries bootstrapping consciousness through the bicameral mind he acts as a preacher adressing the voice of god in the white church dolores attends many of the church services together with a few other hosts we see her entering the church and leaving it in two of her flashbacks for the most part arnold experiment fails turning the hosts into lunatics inspired by the voice of god except for dolores she shows promise the lunatics arnold created end up killing the hosts in white church town as seen in one of the flashbacks of dolores because dolores was part of the cult she attended the church services they let her live ford realises what arnold is doing and they start fighting over it ford also wants to bring in the money men but arnold is against that which causes more problems between the two in order to save all his work the progress he made he creates the maze and hides it possibly storing the key to the maze within dolores arnold ends up dying trying to protect his work dolores might be involved finding the maze destroying the park becomes her quest as instructed by arnold in his last words sort of like the chosen one ford finds out what went down doesn t decommission destroy dolores instead puts her in her modest little loop to ford dolores embodies arnold so when he says that dolores and ford are no longer friends he means arnold arnold managed to hide the key to the maze in his code deep within dolores allowing her to lie to ford ford adresses this in the latest episode saying somewhere under all those updates he is still there perfectly preserved furthermore he says your mind is a walled garden even death cannot kill the flowers that bloom there however ford wasn t aware of arnolds code until the first time dolores went off her loop with william william the first time dolores attempts to fullfill her quest a few years after arnolds death is with william they end up doing the lawrence loop up until the part we saw in episode dolores uses william because he is a guest she won t be called back in by behaviour because she is with him because of their time together dolores ends up telling william tmib about arnold and the deeper level of the game however william whom initially didn t care much about the park ends up falling in love with dolores in the latest episode we saw him slowly changing playing the game william finds out dolores is using him for her own quest he has been played by a host and cheated on his wife because of it this angers him and he somehow prevents her from fullfilling her quest this is how tmib saved the park like he said in possibly involving ford about what went down ford now realises some of arnolds code is still active within dolores dolores fascinates him because she is the only host he doesn t fully control because of his fascination he doesn t want to destroy decommission her and resets her back into her modest little loop once more he destroys buries white church town and all that remains is the top of the church as seen in episode teddy ford creates teddy in the likeliness of william his plan is to eventually trigger the arnold code once more this time using teddy and controllable circumstances note how there are only if william tmib only persons persons that picked up the can that dolores drops teddy william and tmib fords narrative he wants to recreate the old circumstances that caused dolores to go on her quest hence involving teddy and tmib in it takes place in white church town which is still buried underground only the top of the church remains as seen in however he is digging up the town as seen in to recreate it this is where the critical incident happens the first time dolores attempts to fullfill her quest years ago reveries are part of fords narrative because he wants dolores to be able to access previous builds in particular the one where she went on her quest this cause her to remember and hear presumably arnolds voice wyatt represents one of the lunatics arnold created with his preaching in white church town dolores the modern day dolores is not becoming conscious yet she is merely acting in a loop set out for her by ford the reveries and conversations with bernard triggered her old arnold quest line code she is in his fords dream now the reveries are dubbed as a mistake evolution uses only one tool the mistake the reveries could be the mistake that eventually triggers consciousness it is entirely possible that the voice she hears is not of arnold but of ford bernard trying to make her remember her time with arnold almost all the scenes in westworld thus far are dolores in past times except for the ones including teddy tmib in the earlier episodes we only get glimpses of where she is now for example when she draws the maze card and stands alone in the train after seeing the maze symbol ford wants to find the maze can t find it alone realises dolores is the key to the maze recreates circumstances of years ago remember his analogy about the greyhound in episode never seen a greyhound have you bill a greyhound is a racing dog spends his life running in circles chasing a piece of felt made up like a rabbit one day we took it to the park my brother took it of the leash and in that instant the dog spotted a cat must ve looked just like that piece of felt never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog running until at last he finally got it and to the horror of everyone he killed that little cat torn it into pieces that dog spent his whole life trying to catch that thing now it had no idea what to do there are a lot of similarities between ford and the old dog they re both old obviously ford has been chasing arnolds code the maze all his life and perhaps he feels he is close to finding it but realises now that he is so close he has no idea what to do afterwards this might be fords final act in the park tmib the only logical explanation as to why tmib knows about arnold his secrets and the deeper level of the game is because of the time dolores and him spent together tmib william as of yet i don t see how tmib could have gained this knowledge otherwise fell in love with dolores her betrayal and seeing how easily ford controls reset the hosts and dolores finally makes him realise they re not human it angers him that he had feelings for a robot the park slowly consumes him turning william into tmib over time because he saved the park ford grants him vip access comes back to the park regularly over years playing every narrative and finding all the secrets within the park the deeper level slowly consumes him because he can t find it he becomes obsessed with the park bernard i am not sure where to place bernard in all this because he is not part of ford narrative he is only involved with dolores and operates mostly outside the park in the control room it is very possible bernard is a host created by ford there are multiple indications to this one example is ford saying to bernard i know what goes on in that mind of yours bernard another example of this is the dinner ford has with cullen he knows she has been sleeping with bernard and tells her to be careful with bernard he pronounces his name in a very perculiar way because he has a sensitive disposition he created bernard to be his eyes and ears on the workfloor i feel like most employees are afraid of ford hell even cullen is freaked out by him since ford is the only one that knew arnold he might have created bernard to resemble arnold perhaps the way bernard converses and his motives are the same as arnolds after all they both seek to create consciousness furthermore ford is fully aware of the secret conversations between bernard and dolores he can t have those conversations himself because dolores is obviously programmed to lie to ford ford himself can not trigger the arnold code it seems the reveries in combination with bernards conversations can apart from the hosts bernard is the only one that had flashbacks bernard lowe is an anagram arnold weber bernard says something to abernathy just before decommissioning him in the final scene of i have no idea what the significance of that is but it shouldn t be overlooked i think this will prove very important in the next episodes possibly involving the hosts in cold storage

correct so i have been fascinated about the dual timeline william mib theory i used to not believe it like most people i even scoff at people who think there is a dual timeline until i watched so i decided to go back and rewatch everything after re watching three times i found some insights to share what i am doing here is not to say that there is definitely a dual timeline theory but simply point out some discrepancies in the ways the scenes are cut and the story is told these discrepancies can be explained both ways i only choose to interpret them based on a dual timeline theory i still have doubts about the william mib theory though edit i just found something on the war in westworld i have posted it in the comment below but would like to add it here i will insert it before my other points e the war i want to talk about the war in westworld a bit when w l first got there the union soldiers were recruiting showing that the timeline is during the war the war they are talking about here is the civil war here is a quote from the army officer we fight for a free land where no man has to bow then when teddy was given the backstory of wyatt he remembered that he and wyatt used to fight together they fought together in escalante and they were fighting against the native americans which war are the writers alluding to the black hawk indian war gt in captain james andrus led members of the southern utah militia through the escalante area during the black hawk indian war wiki gt the black hawk war or black hawk s war from to wiki that s after the civil war then mib said that he has fought against ghost nation braves with lawrence the only reference i found on ghost nation is a book by john steiner called barer of the ghost nation it tells the story of wanniukaga who is guess what a native american vampire my point is lawrence and mib fought against the native americans before and according to wiki gt as american expansion reached into the west settler and miner migrants came into increasing conflict with the great basin great plains and other western tribes these were complex nomadic cultures based on introduced horse culture and seasonal bison hunting they carried out resistance against united states incursion in the decades after the completion of the civil war and the transcontinental railroad in a series of indian wars which were frequent up until the but continued into the century the series of indian wars were frequent up until the which is about years after the start of the civil war and in present day there is apparently no prevailing native american resistance hence the introduction of sizemore s new narrative about the savages who are apparently native american looking conclusion i feel that the park itself follows a timeline small events may be looped but bigger events like the war and everything might be chronological it is also possible that they do not repeat themselves think about video games these days the small tasks are repetitive and you can do them over and over again but bigger ones such as fighting the boss might just happen once unless you restart end of insert a when william first appeared does anyone remember when william first appeared the beginning of episode right after a voice says to dolores remember correction the voice said do you remember this scene would not have meant much if not for something i noticed in episode when dolores wakes up to find the gun in her drawer the scene cuts to the barn with her and mib when mib said why don t we reacquaint ourselves dolores start at the beginning and then the scene cuts to dolores opening the drawer again with no gun in it i would think that this scene w o the gun happened in the past and notice how they deliberately did not show her father because he would have been someone else in the past and then it cuts to the town showing william if i remember correctly this is the first time william picks up the milk can for dolores thus their beginning correction no w went to hunt down slim he first met dolores in ep it is the beginning i guess of dolores running into william and getting on a journey with him also people mention about the logo looking different in the scenes with william less modern than the ones that would appear later b there is no hector in the william narrative i don t know if you guys remember but when william first appeared the narrative was not about catching hector but about joining the war the sheriff was not there but a troop of soldiers also there is a specific moment in ep when william looked at the wanted list on the wall no hector c there is strictly no teddy in the william narrative i have never seen the two together also please look at ep when ford calls upon teddy to introduce the wyatt he said that there is backstory to teddy s past happened in the time of war rooted in truth the war is apparently happening in the william narrative but never in the mib one only alluded to when he spoke to lawrence about how they have fought in a war together wyatt in the flashback is wearing an army suit i do not see anyone wearing that in the present day narrative only in the william narrative this shows that war was something in the past in the teddy narrative but was presently happening in the william narrative i also feel like with dolores love for teddy she will not easily fall for another person therefore i tend to believe that teddy is non existent years ago in the william timeline d dolores story conclusion first dolores in ep and is retracing her journey with william and logan which happened years ago in the present timeline she is going through the same journey alone many cuts seem to suggest that in the teddy fighting wyatt timeline dolores goes back home alone and sees walter and rebus with a guest her father is the new one this is also when she starts remembering not only mib but also what happened in the same situation year ago during the william timeline the gun she is holding comes from rebus there is a scene of rebus looking for his gun the sound in her head that says kill him seems to be arnold s it is also the same voice that says remember to her she is about to retrace the path of how she ran into william in the woods and went on a journey with him when she got out of the barn i personally feel that it is already showing a scene from the past think about the man who said get back here he is not one of the man she sees in front of her house before she gets dragged into the barn i would like to think that she is starting to remember things from the past after rewatching multiple times i actually find the man in the so called present timeline so no not really a compelling evidence notice how when she finds william she is not carrying a gun because her gun is the present timeline but william s is in the past when she first wakes up in the wild there is a deliberate shot of her holding a gun and also no william in sight when the camera turned there is william giving her a mug and then when she stands up and walks around there is no gun it is kinda like looking for the ring on leo s hand to figure out if he is dreaming in inception lt this right here is actually one of my main points however there is something really confusing about her storyline when she sees lawrence s daughter it seems that she was from a previous narrative where there was a white chapel this is probably a narrative built by arnold i have a feeling this is the one ford is trying to recreate it is also quite obvious that she has been on this path before it could be that her seeing lawrence s daughter is the present and her seeing the sheriff trying to retrieve her is something in the past since the sheriff and william appear in the same frame there is a scene of her finding her own grave this could have been in the past too she died in her white chapel narrative and was buried then she awakened on the trip with william and found the grave then she remembers on her own trip in the present however there is a man standing behind her when she is at her grave who kinda looks like mib this is a very confusing part actually with dolores narrative many things suggest a dual timeline when she was with william she did not know about the maze every time she finds the picture of the maze she is alone therefore i have reasons to believe that she discovered the secret of the maze on her adventure with william and then when initiated by bernard she starts seeing the shape of the maze everywhere as she retraces her journey all by herself in present day timeline think about how she keeps seeing doubles of herself when she is at pariah this is a dead giveaway that she has been to pariah before i think what i need to clarify here is that when she leaves her farm in her present day timeline assuming dual timeline theory she is all by herself she goes to the woods because she has been there in the past and ran into william there she sleeps in the woods alone and wakes up to remember william and logan by her side she goes to pariah alone remembering how she went there with william and logan when she left the psychic s room note how the hallway is empty it was packed with people doing orgy when she walked into the room when she told william about the voice she was confused she just knew that a voice was leading her on however when she is talking to the voice in the scene of her digging the gun she is very certain when she asks here and after her interogation by ford she also replied arnold in a certain voice that she has not told ford anything the change in tone and certainty might be because she is in different timelines many mention how stubbs is in present timeline and questions if she is on her own or with a guest he says to flag it with behavior i feel that the real person in present timeline to flag her is ford himself however argument against the dual timeline theory can also be valid considering that you cannot really pinpoint which part of her journey is in real time which parts are strictly flashbacks and which parts are actually happening in her mind palace above are my clues so far i have re watched everything in a marathon so every clue is fresh to me however this does not mean that mine is the only theory in fact there are some confusing parts to the theory i hope fellow redditors interested in the debate can clarify or even debunk me it is an open discussion edits changed the numbering to letters it creeps me out how i type the right numbers but they all turn to as soon as i post edit formatting edit added more evidences',\n",

       " ' theory in regards to what the maze actually is tldr the maze is a symbolic representation of the journey of the hosts to consciousness and not an actual physical maze and the maze itself is a metaphor for the human brain when i first saw the maze it kind of struck me as a cross section of the brain now normally when we take a cross section of the brain it s from the side which looks as such which compared to the maze nah not quite seeing it yet however if you turn the brain to face forward you get something much more alike to what we saw the maze represented as the brain throughout history has been pictured as a maze the folds in the brain look very much like the winding pathways of a labyrinth which add on to the fact we do not know all that much about how our brain functions or works it very much seems like a mysterious maze in regards to our maze the triangle at the bottom could represent the stem the stem is very much the entrance and exit to our brain from our nervous system the stem is the super highway in which the brain sends out and receives information thus is very much the entrance to the brain now for the meat of my theory sorry if this is rambling on there is one section of the brain that is heavily used when someone is solving a maze the hippocampus the hippocampus is the part of the brain that regulates spatial awareness however it has several other very important functions it s in charge of storing and processing memories as well as our emotions without delving too deep into philosophy one could say our emotions and our memories are a very large part of what makes up our humanity indeed when a person is stricken with alzheimer s one of the first parts of the brain to go is the hippocampus alzheimer s is a very terrible disease and has been described as causing one to lose their personal humanity to bring this back to our maze we should take a look at where the hippocampus is located in the brain from the front not only is it located in the middle of the brain when looking at the brain from the front it also looks somewhat like the body and legs of the man in the maze drawing lets finish the man there is one other part of the brain that is extremely central to our humanity and that is the thalamus the thalamus is what regulates our consciousness dreams and sleep when you combine the two parts they are both teal and squint at bit in this earlier brain picture you can see the man in the middle of the maze so there you go the hippocampus and the thalamus make up the man in the middle of the maze and in functionality they really are the core to what makes us human our dreams our emotions our memories our consciousness these are all the main tenants of humanity that the hosts are trying to come to grips with maeve is constantly trying to come to grips with whether or not her nightmares dreams are actually memories dolores is starting to process emotions that are not within her normal range of story violence and anger her normal mode of operation seems to start with happiness and always end in helpless terror lastly lawrence s daughter tells the man in black he can t enter the maze as it s not for him this is because the mib is already human trying to develop conscious thought is a pointless endeavor as he already has it to sum up again the maze represents the hosts journey to sentience these problems in the hosts really starting happening after their emotions got an upgrade part of the man represented by the hippocampus all the hosts are in the maze already they are just at different points along the journey the maze is all about the hosts finding their humanity for better or worse ',\n",

       " 'this sub is great but i disagree with today s consensus more dual time theory speculation this post assumes you have seen episode also it is long sorry after watching ep contrapasso i felt the showrunners all but confirmed the two time theory then i come to the site and see many have concluded the opposite fun we must keep in mind we watch the show as hosts which means the viewer is subject to the same memory gaps and other trickery the programmers use to keep everything in line the showrunners will rely on this perspective to excuse all of the deceptive cuts and jumps overall the two timelines are showing the two robot revolts as they occur one in the past and one in the present the previous revolt was triggered by arnold s code a few years it is not exactly clear but maybe years after arnold killed himself vanished and during the william logan time frame ford mib drinking session this conversation establishes that mib was involved in revolt and that he played a role in saving the park the humans from the machines mib says almost took this place with him almost but not quite thanks to me it appears he is now back to do the opposite free the machines from the humans total speculation ford is tracking mib in current time because it is the first guest to play his wyatt maze story line mib may also be the board member etc lawrence year ago lawrence s role is el lazo the outlaw at the start of revolt he is operating in some type of nitro confederados loop which william logan and dolores play in episode el lazo playing a role in revolt is the reason william mib knows to track him down years later in his search for the maze william learns of arnold the original programming the deeper meaning during revolt so he starts with these characters again dolores el lazo it is also why lawrence is being hanged ford wanted to punish lazo for his role but kept the original back story outlaw so in current time lawrence is hanged over and over for his past crimes both in story and against ford revolt dolores bernard sessions bernard found the arnold code and is exploring it while dolores believes he is arnold she believes she is being loyal to arnold when she lies to ford there is some foreshadowing of this dynamic how this is possible when dolores sees one person and then it is another herself at some point she will be in a session with bernard and it will flash to arnold in the chair speculation dolores flashbacks scene on train as we saw in the previous episode when hosts access memories from prior loops during the current loop it can almost seem real or predicting the future the church town the final scene of revolt will take place in the church town wyatt is there killing people as we have seen in the flashbacks lawrence s daughter is there dolores is there etc the daughter even says to dolores we came from the same place or something along those lines after revolt ford wants to bury any trace of arnold so he buries the town covers the code puts the offending robots in punishing story loops and executes his plan of making westworld about profit is successful thereafter the train scene i am not exactly sure where dolores is in the current timeline mib time but the train scene makes me believe she is retracing her actions during revolt i do not believe william and lawrence were a hallucination but when she was standing alone it was during the current time frame and she was remembering the first go round various other predictions i believe the season will end showing how revolt ends while introducing the real start of revolt there will be a sad scene between william and dolores where william is forced to kill or subdue her to end revolt this scene will be william s rebirth which turns him into a brutal successful businessperson who holds onto his core white hat ideals charity returning to westworld to free the robots ford knows arnold was the true genius of the park this insecurity is the driving force behind him trying to reboot the arnold code he thinks he can now execute it proving his superiority once and for all this dynamic is why the mib knows he can insult ford when ford says if you want to know just ask and mib replies i would need a shovel mib is essentially really saying ford remember i am one of the few people who know who the true genius of this place was and it isn t you logan will die during the church revolt showdown scene at the end of this season it will pave the way for william s future success he will take logan s job and invest in westworld maybe even dolores will kill logan his death will inspire hector other lame ideas arnold didn t kill himself but left before revolt he is implanting the laser data downloaders and is still trying influence the park from afar not really convinced ford s greyhound story is foreshadowing of dolores and the next host revolt hosts are the dogs ford is removing the leash and he is worried they will tear the felt to pieces humans his park his life s work but his ego and determination to beat arnold are causing him to do it anyway tl dr i believe ep confirmed the two time theory we are watching a replay of revolt and the start of revolt lawrence church town flashbacks mib and ford conversation reveal the truth various other speculations and predictions edit bot caught me and i fixed one dolores spelling well played mr bot ',\n",

westworld you re giving me and everyone on this sub too much credit of course it s about that ok let s begin here are two facts i would like you to pay attention to while you re downvoting me we see dolores off her loop when she is with william we know this because her loop is supposed to be modest and little but she s in pariah which clearly is not at all the former and probably not the latter both in terms of distance from sweetwater compared to the abernathy ranch and purely content indulging in tarot cards during a romanesque orgy doesn t seem quite like the modest loop intended for a rancher s daughter in bout a dub in dis bitch we re presented with a scene featuring present day ford and dolores ford brings up arnold and asks her if she s made contact with him since he originally told her to help him destroy the park years ago she denies the fact that arnold has made contact with her since years days and hours ago i don t think that william s scenes are flashbacks because ford then says the following but you didn t did you you ve been content in your little loop for the most part i wonder if you did take on that bigger role for yourself would you have been the hero or the villain of course this cannot prove or disprove the theory as long as everything that we re witnessing happening with william logan and dolores now on this train with nitrous filled cadavers is just an incredibly minor happenstance that ford can easily forget due to the lack of consequence whatever happens to william and young dolores is insignificant to ford and old dolores since she s been content in staying in her little loop for over years to the point that ford has no clue as to whether or not dolores during william s flashbacks actually made the decision to try to destroy the park or not the hero or villain may either be for or against destroying the park but either way ford has no clue despite being there from day one if william s scenes are flashbacks then their result must be inconclusive in regards to dolores s decision to be a hero or villain in order for ford to wonder whether or not dolores would engage in such a sentience gaining sequence of events that result in a catastrophic failure that bernard and cullen reference in present day proof is unquestionable and my analysis of this dialogue is plenty questionable what i don t believe is questionable is that if william s scenes are flashbacks then it s a doomed story arc that seems irrelevant to the same man who is weary of and determined to stop anyone who wants to get in his way or destroy his park if dolores has been content then whatever she s accomplishing with william is so insignificant that it would go unnoticed by ford that she ever had any desire to leave her loop and engage in arnold s initiative to become either the hero or the villain extra special bonus theory just because i love you people we know that dolores is not ford s creation based on this scene s dialogue it s arnold s arnold the person who created you for as much as ford sees himself as a god and so i made my own world he does not acknowledge that dolores is his own but arnold s your mind is a walled garden even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there i take this as specifically dolores s mind not all hosts s arnold created something deep within dolores that cannot be erased as easily as the butchers do once they process each host after its death in addition to the voice commands that remain from arnold s original bicameral mind programming there s something unique that s left in dolores that arnold created which ford cannot find understand or turn off this is the violent delights violent ends bug which ford s reveries update unwittingly accessed that caused specifically dolores due to her father s unique history to initiate she then gives this same bug to maeve who is the only other host to have flashbacks arnold s unique programming in dolores is what allows her to maintain it despite death which triggers maeve to become sentient and achieve the same death defying programming via this guy after dolores utters it to her are we very old friends dolores asks this to which ford responds definitely no i wouldn t say friends dolores i wouldn t say that at all which ford then winces after saying in we hear a similar line uttered by william this is in reference to logan who by is made clear to not be a friendly colleague of his but rather a higher up who considers william a corporate puppet that s coincidentally married to his sister william corrects clementine during their encounter of the second episode by stating he does not view logan as a friend logan is out to use and stop william when he tries to do whatever it is he s trying to do which is exactly what dolores via arnold is trying to do to ford ford doesn t see dolores not as a friend because he lets her live in a hell filled with rape and death but simply because he knows she s as much arnold as the arnold that tried to stop him by letting the hosts kill the guests which is essentially his enemy because it would destroy his life s work dizkuce ',\n",

mechanical here are images from ford s flashback showing lifelike hosts with flesh and blood from before the park opened the old hosts had lifelike flesh and blood exteriors over a metal skeleton and circuitry the new hosts are printed with real or real ish bones and organs in giant vats of milk like stuff in episode we even saw them pump blood into a new host and start his heart beating it was pretty cool felix told maeve that host and human anatomies were the same these are the differences mib lamented episode shows us a family of original arnold built hosts modelled after ford s family and they are very lifelike including a dog who is later shown dead in a pool of blood there seems to be a spectrum of old hosts mixed in with new ones in william s time there is an old man with an eyepatch who tries to give william a treasure hunting quest this host appears to be more stiff in his movements and less adept at navigating dialogue once he gets started in his script he does not appear to notice logan telling him to go away but doesn t dolores flash back to the mib before shooting rebus and riding off to william s camp dual timeframe theories are predicated on the notion that the events of the story are not being presented strictly in chronological order the argument i saw dolores shoot rebus before i saw dolores collapse in william s camp amounts to circular logic your theory that the show is not chronological is untrue because the show is chronological most dual timeframe theories suggest that dolores collapses in william s camp is not in fact the aftermath of dolores shoots rebus and that these scenes were shot and edited in an intentionally misleading way to obscure the show s chronology see the discussion on misdirections elsewhere on this page edit this screenshot demonstrates that dolores did not in fact have the gun in her hands when she arrived at william s camp why does she wake up with the gun see the explanation in the screenshot link dolores s story episode about running away from home does not jibe with the situation and backstory we know she experienced on reebus shooting night it is important to note that dolores wandering in a daze appears to be about as common as teddy gets killed or beaten as for the gun we ve seen her dig a gun out of the earth find a gun in her drawer and we ve seen her holding a gun in nearly every church graveyard flashback the rebus shooting is by no means the only event which could have led to dolores wandering into william amp logan s camp is actually much more consistent with the other evidence further some have suggested that dolores is not holding the gun when she collapses in william s camp and her wake up with gun and suddenly william moment may be the first of several suddenly william moments which among polychronists are commonly accepted to indicate dolores in the present alone re tracing the steps of her journey with william edit an unarmed dolores is confirmed by this screenshot this scene pair is one of a few scene pairs which appear to be intentional misdirections to lead the viewers to assume certain events are concurrent these misdirections are always accompanied by easily overlooked clues or alternate explanations which we believe will be evident to everyone upon re watching the show after the big reveal most dual timeframe theories seem to agree that william logan s thread has been presented more or less chronologically and mib s maeve s thread has been presented more or less chronologically and the delos headquarters scenes can be timeframe identified largely by the park events they relate to so a dual timeframe reveal won t shatter the entire story s chronology it will simply be a matter of mentally rearranging larger threads only a few sequences are misleading in the way they apparently bridge two scenes which are not concurrent here is a general discussion on misdirection but doesn t stubbs see straying dolores and send someone to retrieve her followed by a scene of a sheriff attempting to retrieve her in las mudas then in the same scene we see stubbs running the mib s pyrotechnic jailbreak in the present there are two common interpretations of this moment this seems to be the consensus stubbs is seeing dolores s stray event in the present and the sheriff is retrieving her from her stray event in the past these two scenes are not connected but edited in a deliberately misleading way this is somewhat corroborated by the fact that stubbs doesn t seem to be aware she s with a guest despite the fact that she has clearly been traveling with william amp logan edit in episode a solo dolores is apparently pulled from the pariah parade and has a diagnostic interview with ford this may be the result of her flagging in the present i may the only one suggesting this stubbs sees stray dolores is years in the past this implies that stubbs is a host why would i go through these mental gymnastics rather than accepting the scenes at face value these scenes are clearly designed to make us assume correctly or incorrectly that the stubbs sees dolores and stubbs runs pyrotechnics scenes are the same scene they happen in succession and the setting colors etc are consistent unless you re looking closely you probably don t even notice that stubbs outfit changes between these scenes from a collared sweater jacket to a collarless shirt and you probably don t even notice that there s a completely different staff operating the map during the second scene no sign of budget grace jones anywhere i think this bears the hallmark of a classic misdirection the scenes are similar enough that everyone assumes they are concurrent but upon inspection there are subtle differences that may tell another story are they necessarily years apart of course not but they are apart and we were led to overlook that this alone does not suggest anything as extreme as william mib but it is consistent with other evidence which suggests that he may be it s also notable and unique that no other recognizable delos staff is in either scene budget grace jones appears to be named folake olowofoyeku and should be congratulated for her role in a future classic no disrespect was intended by my silly nickname wait what stubbs is a host well only in my interpretation which is not representative of all dual timeline theories however if i were delos i might be interested in a security officer who can be sent into dangerous situations without with no liability for loss of human life and who can be programmed with quick reflexes and no misgivings about say sawing a host s head off manually a security officer who in the previous episode dropped a cute little backstory hint that he may be a host and whose weapon carrying was questioned in the same scene that we learned hosts ability to carry weapons is restricted selectively it s absolutely possible that these quips were simple banter with no special meaning but they strike me very much as cute little in jokes for viewers to pick up when re watching the season the important takeaway is simply that the hint was planted if someone is going to turn out to be a surprise host which i think is inevitable any good writing team will have provided some clues along the way but are you saying that dolores glitches achieves sentience twice and if so why didn t they decommission her at this point there s no reason to assume any host has or will achieve sentience that seems to be the direction they re going but if you can t tell does it really matter may very well be the conclusive theme however the dual timeframe theories do suggest that dolores has gone stray at least twice once with william logan years ago and again after the reveries violent delights rebus shooting in the present as of episode i and i think most polychronists anticipate that the next few episodes will result in the critical failure most likely as the result of dolores acting under arnold voice influence dolores will be placed into a modest little loop with teddy to keep her bound to her path as well as a lot of programming and suggestions to prevent her wanderlust she will as we have seen overcome this loop and ride off of her loop after ford introduces the reveries and ford sends teddy away on his wyatt excursion on a critical night there is no reason to believe the hosts awakening is a singular once and for all process in fact we have evidence that maeve remembers the hazmat techs draws them hides her drawing and forgets on several occasions and the show suggests that she may have been spying on felix and sylvester for quite a long time even dolores overcoming her programming to shoot rebus may have occurred several times her flashbacks in that scene seem to suggest that it has happened at least twice once in which she ran away and was tummy shot by mr jerkface and once in which she remembered the tummy shot and rode away before mr jerkface could shoot her is dual timeframes the same as william mib or logan mib typically but not necessarily it s possible to believe there are two timeframes to the westworld story without any particular connection between william logan and mib however there have been several notable parallels between the mib s personality and backstory and logan s or william s furthermore in episode we saw william logan begin a journey which works perfectly as the mib s origin story if dual timeframes is true isn t it just a cheap gimmick which undermines the deep themes the show has been exploring what kind of dramatic payoff could possibly result from this reveal you are right that if dual timeframes alone is the big twist this could be a cheap gimmick and frankly it would demonstrate a lack of subtlety considering many people predicted it as early as episode and it s been increasingly obvious with each episode but as far as i anticipate dual timelines won t be the big reveal it will simply be the story we re being told a story about characters navigating westworld and their year history and character arcs and how the past instigated the present the present parallels the past and how the year partnership rivalry between ford and alleged arnold plays itself to a conclusion in the long relationships between these people and their so lifelike does it matter if they re machines playthings like godfather if coppola had had a compelling reason to obscure the past present divide with some ageless characters and memory erasures which would actually be kind of cool bronxworld i think the big twist is more likely to be related to a character s development and the dual timelines reveal will simply be the utilitarian chronology which supports it the timeline has been obscured not for the sake of gimmickry but because clarifying it would blow essential character revelations too early for a dramatic payoff for example by revealing his agelessness well before we ve witnessed his dramatic and gradual awakening to his own identity of course this is just my one interpretation and i can t predict the dramatic payoff after only episodes but i m inclined to give the writers credit and anticipate that if there is a dual timeframe reveal it will support a deeper reveal which amplifies the character arcs and the potency of the show s themes but what about the guest who can be seen in the background of two scenes which are supposedly years apart u cyberhubbs has used some seriously impressive investigative skills to point out that the same character is seen in both a past and present scene and that the actor has confirmed that he was playing a guest not a host considering he is an extra his shots are probably directorial choices and not part of the writing so i think it s unlikely that this is a deliberate clue that said we polychronists have defended our share of questionable clues which could be explained as production errors so it would be hypocritical of me to simply dismiss something as clear and verifiable as these screenshots i don t think this is strong enough to overwhelm all of the contrary evidence but i must admit it s one solid point against dual timeframes edit added doesn t dual timeframes require all sorts of convoluted logic mental gymnastics and over complicated explanations nearly all of the explanations here can be summed up rather simply this scene occurred prior to that scene any further explaining is simply to point out the evidence which supports this assertion at this point it would take considerably more mental gymnastics to explain how this evidence could be consistent with a single timeframe scenario but what about when they were walking into pariah and logan said arnold died y stop that didn t happen but what about that screenshot from the episode preview showing dolores talking to mib in her gunslinger outfit the same outfit she wore with william i won t comment on an episode i haven t seen however isn t the theory kind of arbitrary a lot of evidence supports it including the visual clues and logo changes which have grown more and more consistent with each episode a large number of subtle and overt parallels between the mib and the william logan plotline an episode in which william logan s activities match mib s stated backstory and perfectly set up what we know of the mib s history a notable lack of overlap between the two plotlines as of episode a notable absence of key delos staff members in scenes definitively tied to either the william logan or mib plotlines or acknowledging them in any way notable distinctions between dolores william dialogue and the events backstory we know she had on rebus shooting night the convenient killing of lawrence in the scene immediately prior to his reveal as el lazo in episode el lazo lawrence and dolores are the two strongest threads connecting william logan plot with mib s the anticipated trajectory of the dual timeline theory actually predicted this reveal some of these may turn out to be coincidences or over interpretation but at this point there are too many for it to be pure coincidence the dual timeframe theory is either true or it is a deliberate misdirection on the writers parts since dual timeframe theories inherently assume we are being misdirected somehow it s not implausible to suspect the dual timeline clues may be an enormous red herring but at this point it would be hard to argue that it s just grasping at straws ',\n",

       " 'william is not the mib part thorough very long debunking post this will not include evidence that s already been debunked by others outlined in the theory master post for both sides first of all i m writing this out because i want to hash out my own opinion in my own post and i love this show to bits i respect the opinions of two timeline william mib theorists and the discourse they create so i ask for respect in return heck i was one of you myself until episode three aired the theory has too much mental gymnastics for me to believe in it it devalues the character arcs of several characters dolores william logoan the mib too many to count and makes their entire growth obsolete too much screen time has been spent on their separate stories that melding two characters together would waste all of it dolores is the biggest one she isn t retracing her steps from thirty years ago alone stubbs checked on her in the present as she was far off her narrative loop too see if she was with a guest and she was with william if she wasn t they would ve recalled her guys no one in west world is going to let a host wander around off track she s just had her doorstop teddy taken from her due to the linear nature of the show he s off with mib at the same time she s off with william they re also in two completely different sections of the park though probably headed in the same direction mib and dolores have the same goal the maze this is so that they can meet up in a suitably dramatic fashion most people rely on evidence from earlier episodes that have been overridden in more recent ones also theorists who discuss it as fact and immediately dismiss all other viewpoints annoy me so there s that just flashbacks the only time period we re seeing is the present and the past in brief flashbacks a huge part of the mystery of the show imo comes from not exactly knowing wtf were the circumstances surrounding arnold s death mib the badass that he is was present there and saved the park somehow william a completely different character is coming back to the scene of the event thirty years later see the episode preview the proof of this is the setting and the flashbacks we ve had so far thirty years ago the park was much smaller centring around a small town as the main attraction fords own flashback with his cgi ed younger self and dolores multiple flashbacks to a small town with that has a church with a black spire this is the place she and william arrive to in the present in the episode preview arnold is calling her home to her first iteration which he is awakening memories off via the update so she can help him destroy ford and the park somehow more proof dolores s last live interaction with arnold was over thirty years ago said in a flashback she has with ford in episode close to the start of the parks foundation she has more conversations with him his cool uploaded ghost self while travel with william supporting the fact it takes place after that interaction william and logan also have a talk in pariah where the latter notes that one of the founders died in suspicious circumstances that almost shut the park down the fact that she has these moments alone shows she is blocking out other people so she can talk to her digital master in analysis mode both william and lawrence have left her alone at this point confusing editing i will admit early on the editing was purposefully trying to deceive us but it has nothing to do with multiple timeline shenanigans instead it centres around arnold keeping his digital resurrection a secret from his enemy ford the editing was merely trying to hide that fact dolores s gun and her being confused about it was arnold trying to hide his involvement from ford ford has already tried to spy on dolores via bernard s talks with her but arnold wised up to him and kept his digital self hidden now that she is off loop and with a guest arnold is finally trying to force his plans forward though i believe that fords new narrative is his way of trying to stop this from coming to fruition that is a whole other post more evidence story progression is linear you can tell this from timing especially with teddy in episode he goes off with a guest to attack wyatt and is captured and bloodily tethered to a tree the men who were with him come back to sweetwater and tell dolores he is probably dead this makes teddy absent during the evening when she goes home and sees her farm is under attack now that he isn t there to protect her she takes up arms and shoots her rapist before fleeing on a horse into williams camp clementine is also another reason as she is decommissioned in episode she is taken out of the narrative this means william s scenes with her take place before this event undeniably in the present how mib and williams journeys are separate they are two different characters with different story arcs everything about william and the mib is different their personalities beliefs arcs everything examples william is kind and heroic while the mib is dark and sadistic william views the hosts as people the mib doesn t etc they are both well written flawed characters in their own right one isn t going to become the other two timeline w mib theorists believe that something traumatic will happen to william and that dolores is the catalyst she will betray his love and mould him into the cynic that he is now except the thing is the mib is also a sadist something that william isn t the mib s sadism isn t also directed solely at dolores since he s terrorised others e g maeve teddy the entire park in his own words multiple times this is fundamentally out of character for william i m not going to argue if dolores was raped or not i don t want to even go there though i do support the dolores will go ex machina on william theory if it does happen it will be at the end of the season most of all though they ignore the fundamental theme of the show and the crux of all its characters duality both william and the mib have their own duality they are foils to one another the biggest being their lives outside the park vs their lives inside other than that william is experiencing the park for the first time mib for the last one is white hat the other black hat again etc you guys get it outside the park mib s job is that he runs a foundation that cures people of diseases but inside while on holiday he is his true self a ruthless sadist with william outside he has a perfectly normal job and life that he has worked hard for and thought he wanted inside the park he finally gets to experience his true self by living an adventure similar to ones in the books he had when growing up the real way he wants to live his life therefore it is true the parks is who you could be conclusion and tldr william is not the mib because of the myriad of reasons stated above part is going to be about logos and all the other main evidence of the theory as well as why bernard being a host disproves it that might be a whole post on its own lmao i wanted to do separate posts as there is simply too much to write please try to debunk the debunking in the comments i love this

       " ' the maze is all that matters now the maze is clearly fundamental to the story of westworld and the dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness let s take a look at what we know about it so far the maze gt the maze itself is the sum of a man s life choices he makes dreams he hangs on to and there at the center there s a legendary man who had been killed over and over again countless times but always clawed his way back to life the man returned for the last time and vanquished all his oppressors in a tireless fury he built a house around that house he built a maze so complicated only he could navigate through it i reckon he d seen enough of fighting teddy episode the concept of the maze permeates westworld and the symbol for it constantly pops up throughout the park we see it in kissy s scalp when lawrence s daughter draws it in the sand on slim s coffin on the train out of pariah as a branding device used to brand traitors in ford s notebook and on the table in a small town the hosts never seem to notice the symbol or pay much attention to it but we as viewers are constantly reminded of its ubiquiti in westworld in his session with dolores bernard or possibly arnold refers to the maze as a game or a test for the hosts gt there is something i d like you to try it s a game it s called the maze it s a very special kind of game the goal is to find the center of it if you can do that then maybe you can be free bernard episode similarly the mib refers to it as the deepest level of the game created by arnold before he died a true story with real stakes gt but then arnold went and broke his own rule he died right here in the park except i believe he had one story left to tell a story with real stakes real violence the mib episode gt but i think there s a deeper meaning hiding under all that something the person who created it wanted to express something true the mib episode gt in ford s game even if i go to the outer edges you can t kill me you can t even leave a lasting mark but there s a deeper game here teddy arnold s game and that game cuts deep the mib episode lawrence s daugther informs us however that the game isn t meant for the mib gt the maze isn t meant for you lawrence s daughter episode this leads to the obvious conclusion that the maze is for the hosts and not the human guests and as bernard or arnold explains if the hosts can complete the maze then maybe they can be free freedom in terms of the hosts means achieving the one thing that seperates them from the humans that they re supposed to mimic consciousness being conscious that is being self aware and having free will is at this point the only thing that seperates a human from a host the maze is a game left behind by arnold to rectify this to allow the hosts the chance to achieve consciousness this would certainly be something true a real game with real stakes and a game that cuts deep so let s take a look at what arnold believed constituted consciousness the pyramid of host consciousness gt our hosts began to pass the turing test after the first year but that wasn t enough for arnold he wasn t interested in the appearance of intellect or wit he wanted the real thing he wanted to create consciousness he imagined it as a pyramid memory improvisation self interest and at the top never got there but he had a notion of what it might be he based it on a theory of consciousness called the bicameral mind see arnold built a version of that cognition in which the hosts heard their programming as an inner monologue with the hopes that in time their own voice would take over it was a way to bootstrap consciousness ford episode arnold imagined consciousness as a pyramid consisting of four components memory improvisation self interest and something unknown at the top and his means of enabling or bootstrapping consciousness was based on the theory of the bicameral mind or the god voice inside the hosts their programmed inner monologue let s take a look at each of the four components and how each of them assists the hosts on their journey through the maze component memory gt years ago ford s partner wrote half the code this place was founded on what you said in the lab was right we don t know how the hosts work and i think there s something wrong with them ford s explanation only bolsters my hunch the ability to deviate from program behavior arises out of the host s recall of past iterations bernard episode memory is the base component of consciousness it s the basis on which consciousness is built in order to evolve you have to be able to remember the last stage of the process if you constantly forget what you ve learned it s like trying to build a house on quicksand this is the reason that the hosts memories are continuously wiped at the end of each narrative loop and maintenance session the westworld staff understands the potential risk of allowing the hosts to remember what happens to them gt can you imagine how fucked we d be if these poor assholes ever remembered what the guests do to them elsie episode gt the concern is that the hosts will remember some of their experiences and act on them theresa episode when we enter the story however there has just been an update called the reveries that allows the hosts gestures to be tied to specific memories rather than just being generic movements gt how the memories are purged at the end of every narrative loop gt but they re still in there waiting to be overwritten he found a way to access them like a subconscious bernard and elsie episode this update essentially allows the host to remember past events that are supposed to have been wiped at the end of the narrative loop these memories spark the next stage of the evolution of consciousness component improvisation gt you re thinking there s a connection between memory and gt and improvisation yes out of repetition comes variation and after countless cycles of repetition these hosts they were varying they were on the verge of some kind of change theresa and bernard episode we know that the hosts are programmed to improvise to a certain degree in order to enhance the quality of the experience of the paying guests gt the hosts are supposed to stay within their loops stick to their scripts with minor improvisations theresa episode however the ability to recall past events is causing the hosts to deviate from their primary directives and their programmed narrative loops and thus allows for a lot of behavioral improvisations gt in each case we examined the malfunctioning hosts were not resetting properly the retention of data that hadn t been wiped overloaded their decision making apparatus eventually causing a system failure that allowed for override of their primary rule set theresa episode we see this most clearly with some of the major characters like dolores and maeve who are basically making up their own stories as they go because of their memories of past events but we also see it with some of the minor characters like the outlaw walter gt he kills six hosts he lets the other three go i pulled the narrative logs all six of these hosts were part of storylines over the years in which they killed walter it s like he was holding a grudge elsie episode the memories are however only one part of what allows the hosts to improvise the other part has to do with the bicameral mind system that arnold uses to communicate with the hosts gt someone else has been using the bicameral control system for weeks to retask hosts several of them it had to have been the older models the newer ones don t have receivers but these modifications they are serious changing loops breaking loops some of these changes are to their prime directives bernard they could lie to us maybe even hurt us or the guests gt who issued the modifications gt i don t know the best i could tell arnold he s a pretty fucking prolific coder for a dead guy whatever argument he was having with ford it doesn t seem like he was done making his point elsie and bernard episode arnold is communicating with several of the hosts as a voice in their heads making them improvise their behavior and allowing them to lie the most glaring example of this is obviously dolores who constantly hears arnold s voice helping her to remember and guiding her to him but again we see a similar pattern with some of the other hosts gt have you been hearing voices has arnold been speaking to you again gt no he doesn t know i didn t tell him anything ford and dolores episode gt thinking this one s still thirsty not gonna die this time arnold ain t nothing gonna kill me walter episode gt it caught the rabbit and it killed it and then someone told me to put it out of its misery a voice arnold he told me it was a killer but it wasn t its fault it was made that way and i could help it if it was dead it couldn t hurt anything anymore young robert episode gt parts of me are quite old there are some elegant formal structures a kind of recursive beauty but complex like two minds arguing with each other there are things in me things i was designed to do that are just out of my reach they almost seem to be dormant who is arnold maeve episode the memories and the ability to improvise spark the next stage in the evolution of consciousness component self interest gt dreams mean everything they re the stories we tell ourselves of what could be who we could become have you been dreaming again dolores imagining yourself breaking out of your modest little loop ford episode we know that the hosts are built as entertainment for the paying customers in westworld and therefore have no self interest or free will they are there to serve and nothing more gt what if i told you that you were wrong dolores that there are no chance encounters that you and everyone you know were built to gratify the desires of the people who pay to visit your world bernard episode gt choices lawrence you know you tell yourself you ve been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own because if you did consider your choices you d be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend that no choice you ever made was your own you have always been a prisoner the mib episode however as some of the hosts have developed the ability to recall prior events and improvise behavior they have also developed self interest again we see this displayed most clearly in our two main host protagonists dolores and maeve gt i think i think i want to be free dolores episode gt sometimes i feel like something s calling me telling me there s a place for me somewhere beyond all this dolores episode gt you said people come here to change the story of their lives i imagined a story where i didn t have to be the damsel dolores episode gt all my life i ve prided myself on being a survivor but surviving is just another loop i m getting out of here you two are going to help me maeve episode gt time to write my own fucking story maeve episode so some of the hosts have almost made it to the top of the pyramid but they need the last piece of the puzzle we don t know what is at the top of the pyramid because according to ford arnold didn t know it but the show has given us several clues that allow us to speculate regarding what is at the top of the pyramid component suffering gt it s beautifully done really but you see the cracks after a while that s why i like the basic emotions you know what that means it means when you re suffering that s when you re most real the mib episode having humanity being defined by its suffering is not an uncommon trope in stories about ai in the matrix this is how agent smith believes humans define their reality gt but i believe that as a species human beings define their reality through misery and suffering agent smith the matrix and depite being a bit gloomy it makes a lot of sense suffering is in many ways a function of the other levels in the consciousness pyramid memory free will and self interest without these things we would just be empty shells we would be hosts without grief there would be no joy without pain or death there would be no life we hear the phrase this pain is all i have left of him her them uttered several times throughout the show by bernard dolores and maeve we need these dichotomies to categorize and conceptualize our existence and so the hosts would need to be aware of their suffering to achieve consciousness and become truly alive as we see in the show once the hosts become aware of their suffering this is when they start to deviate from their programmed behavior once peter abernathy finds out that his world is a lie and what they do to his precious dolores he loses it and has to be lobotomized once walter remembers that the other hosts have killed him in previous loops he loses it and has to be lobotomized the best example of becoming conscious through suffering is maeve when she finds out the horrible truth about her existence from felix it leads to improvisation and eventually a system crash this is even more evident in the flashback of her previous build gt i killed her and her daughter just to see what i felt then just when i thought it was done the woman refused to die and then something miraculous happened in all my years coming here i had never seen anything like it she was alive truly alive if only for a moment and that was when the maze revealed itself to me the mib episode when the mib kills her daughter the suffering allows maeve to override her primary directives she is able to attack and hurt a guest she is also able to ignore both the verbal and the tablet commands from the westworld staff gt my baby my baby gt sir she won t respond to verbal commands we can t shut her down gt i don t understand she s not responding to anything her cognition s fragmented maeve westworld tech and bernard episode when she is suffering the most we literally see her lying in the center of the maze likewise when she is brought in to bernard and ford as she is suffering we see her cognitive fragmentation take the shape of the maze symbol this is what is in the center of the maze and at the top of the consciousness pyramid suffering human emotions we even see the image of a man in the center of the maze symbol symbolizing that completing the maze finding the center is about becoming human completing the maze is a rite of passage it is climbing the pyramid of consciousness it s like growing up it s the human story it starts with memories it evolves with improvisation and self interest and it ends with an understanding of human emotions it doesn t matter whether you take a literal journey like dolores or a mental journey like maeve the journey is the same the maze is the sum of a man s life memories the choices he makes improvisation the dreams he hangs on to self interest and understanding the emotions that come with the experience dolores describes the journey of discovering human emotions poetically in her session with bernard or arnold when she describes suffering by adapting a scripted dialogue about love gt the pain their loss it s all i have left of them you think the grief will make you smaller inside like your heart will collapse in on itself but it doesn t i feel spaces opening up inside me like a building with rooms i ve never explored dolores episode the non host players obviously the hosts completing the maze and achieving consciousness has implications for some of the important non host characters in the show such as ford arnold and the mib ford seems to revel in being the almighty and omniscient creator and god of westworld consequently the notion of the maze and the hosts being conscious wouldn t appeal to him on any level gt it doesn t get cold doesn t feel ashamed doesn t feel a solitary thing that we haven t told it to ford episode gt just don t forget the hosts are not real they re not conscious you mustn t make arnold s mistake ford episode in fact ford claims that he is acutally doing the hosts a favor or a kindness by keeping them unconscious and under his control gt i have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden a weight and we have spared them that anxiety self loathing guilt the hosts are the ones who are free free here under my control ford episode gt when you have finished i will give you the one thing you want most right now i will free you from those memories of what you have done and the memory of your relationship with theresa recalling it would only deepen your grief and potentially draw unwanted attention best to move forward with clear eyes ford episode gt there that s better an old trick from an old friend you need not suffer maeve i ll take it from you ford episode gt in this place the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious as for the hosts the least we can do is make them forget ford episode ford is essentially doing whatever he can to make sure that the hosts do not achieve consciousness and become life like to the point where he loses his complete control over them and he is actually doing it while making the hosts believe he is doing them a solid rather than what he is actually doing which is keeping them slaves that are controlled by no one other than ford himself and certainly not the hosts themselves and who are to be used as sport for paying customers currently there are very few things in westworld that ford doesn t seem to be able to control but one of those things is arnold arnold appears to have been the complete opposite of ford arnold wanted the hosts to be conscious and even threatened ford and tried to stop him from gt arnold wasn t interested in the appearance of wit or intellect he wanted the real thing he wanted to create consciousness his search for consciousness consumed him totally barely spoke to anyone except the hosts in his alienation he saw something in them he saw something that wasn t there ford episode gt you re not the first man to threaten me arnold came to feel the way you do he couldn t stop me either and as exquisite as this array of emotions is even more sublime is the ability to turn it off ford episode his search for consciousness appears to have been why arnold created the maze and even years after his death arnold still seems to be fighting for the hosts to achieve consciousness he is using the bicameral control system to communicate with the hosts and modify their prime directives gt what does this mean some of her attributes have already been changed paranoia self preservation gt fuck someone has already been altering her in an unlogged session someone with a fuck ton more privileges than us felix and sylvester episode gt arnold built them as a gift he said the great artists always hid themselves in their work ford episode and despite bernard saying that ford was responsible for the reveries update i believe that arnold was also responsible for that thus allowing the hosts access to their memories when maeve is suffering from the loss of her child and is non responsive to verbal and tablet commands ford plays a song called reverie to calm her down gt there that s better an old trick from an old friend ford episode the reveries song trick to calm the hosts down when they were suffering and non responsive was arnold s so it would make sense that the update by the same name is his as well enabling the hosts to access memories is arnold s way of letting the hosts into the maze and begin their journey towards consciousness and his communications with them and his changing of their attributes through the bicameral control system is his way of guiding them through the maze gt there s a voice inside me telling me what i have to do and it s telling me i need you dolores episode gt this is what arnold wants he wants me to remember dolores episode gt i was certain that was the place arnold would meet me there he d help dolores episode finally we have the the other thing that ford doesn t seem to be able to control in westworld the mib he seems to be on arnold s side gt you ever heard of a man named arnold you could say he was the original settler of these parts he created a world where you could do anything you want except one thing you can t die which means no matter how real this world seems it s still just a game but then arnold went and broke his own rule he died right here in the park except i believe he had one story left to tell a story with real stakes real violence you could say i m here to honor his legacy the mib episode at first glance the mib seems to be the villain of the story but once we understand that reliving bad memories and suffering is a part of the path to consciousness and freedom his intentions take on a whole new meaning when he takes dolores into the barn pulls out a knife and says why don t we reacquaint ourselves dolores start at the beginning he is probably doing her a favor he is a classic anti hero gt choices lawrence you know you tell yourself you ve been at the mercy of mine because it spares you consideration of your own because if you did consider your choices you d be confronted with a truth you could not comprehend that no choice you ever made was your own you have always been a prisoner what if i told you i m here to set you free the mib episode gt no you don t understand lawrence this time i m never going back the mib episode gt if you re looking for the moral of the story you could simply ask gt i d need a shovel the man i d be asking died years ago almost took this place with him almost but not quite thanks to me ford and the mib episode i suspect however that his motivations for helping the hosts achieve consciousness and finding the center of the maze are less altruistic than arnold s and more selfish than merely wanting the hosts to be free gt the maze is all that matters now and besting wyatt is the last step in unlocking it to having what both our sorry lives lack meaning to giving our choices consequence even if it kills us the mib episode if he is indeed william maybe he is looking for a way to reconnect with dolores and have her return his love or maybe his life in the real world never meant as much to him as his life in westworld and this is why his wife committed suicide and his daughter hates him but living in a game without real consequences or meaning isn t enough for him or maybe he too like the hosts lacks an appreciation of human emotions and suffering he has to kill maeve and her daughter just to see if he would feel anything and he is really looking for the same thing the hosts are we really don t know enough about him at this point to be sure what his motivations are but from what we do know he seems to me to be fighting for what he believes is a worthy cause ',\n",

parts highlighted with bold are based on the information revealed in the most recent episode episode time period years prior to current events the glorious early days years ago gt for three years we lived here in the park refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside myself a team of engineers and my partner his name was arnold those early years were glorious no guests no board meetings just pure creation our hosts began to pass the turing test after the first year ford episode according to bernard arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on years ago but this is the first period that we know of in westworld this was at the beginning when ford arnold and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the turing test we can make an estimate about when this three year period took place we know that arnold died years and days prior to current events we know that he died right before the park opened and we know that he and ford spent three years working in the park before it opened gt last contact years days seven hours ago the day that arnold died dolores episode gt and then right before the park opened one of the partners killed himself logan episode gt for three years we lived here in the park refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside ford episode this means that the park opened to guests roughly years ago shortly after arnold s demise and they began working there three years prior to that roughly years ago from ford s flashback in episode and dolores flashback in episode we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period there were dolores maeve angela peter abernathy armistice lawrence s daughter teddy flood and rebus dolores amp arnold s sessions years ago gt there s something i d like you to try it s a game a secret it s called the maze it s a very special kind of game dolores the goal is to find the center of it if you can do that then maybe you can be free arnold episode these sessions are between dolores and arnold since we know that bernard is made in the image of arnold these sessions take place in a diagnostic facility under the white church since we see dolores enter this facility through the white church in one of her flashbacks gt it s a remote diagnostic facility ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta i had no idea this one was here bernard episode they probably took place after the first hosts had passed the turing test a year after they started working in the park and before arnold died years ago so they took place sometime between years ago the sessions between arnold and dolores were held in secret gt i think it would be best if you not mention the things we ve been talking about arnold episode in the first two sessions we see episode they talk about change and arnold seems facinated by dolores whom he finds different and special gt there s something different about you about the way you think i find it fascinating but others may not see it that way arnold episode gt it s like the other books we ve read it s about change seems to be a common theme dolores episode in the third session episode arnold seems to have doubts about what he is doing with dolores but when she starts showing signs of human consciousness he decides to keep going down the path that they ve started gt i need to decide what to do with you i think i made a mistake i was just fascinated i was being selfish but i think it would be better if i restored you to the way you were before no dolores let s see where this path leads arnold episode in the fourth session episode arnold decides to let dolores try the maze game he sends her away from the town with the white church to travel the path of the maze gt there s something i d like you to try it s a game a secret it s called the maze it s a very special kind of game dolores the goal is to find the center of it if you can do that then maybe you can be free arnold episode in the fifth session episode we see dolores return to the town with the white church and reunite with arnold after having traveled the path of the maze gt you came back it s very good to see you dolores gt i ve been looking for you you told me to follow the maze that it would bring me joy but all i found was pain and terror arnold and dolores episode the fact that dolores has been away from the town with white church on her journey and has found her way back is further substantiated by lawrence s daughter who asks dolores if she found what she went looking for upon dolores return to the town gt good morning did you find what you were looking for dolores lawrence s daughter episode so dolores and arnold s sessions began in secret under the white church then arnold sent dolores away to travel the path of the maze and then she returned to the town upon having completed the maze the massacre in sweetwater and the town with the white church escalante years ago gt the park hasn t had a critical failure in over years bernard episode in one of dolores flashbacks in episode we see the massacre in the town with the white church unfold if we assume that ford s flashback in episode which depicts the same scene when they re dancing before the massacre begins is from the early glorious years after the hosts passed the turing test years ago it stands to reason that dolores flashback is from the same time and since the park hasn t had a critical failure in over years according to theresa we can surmise that this event took place somtime between years ago what led to this massacre and how it unfolded is unclear but we ve seen the same massacre in teddy s flashback from his point of view where he shoots people with a rifle along with the mysterious wyatt the union soldiers and teddy refer to the town as escalante in fact we might ve even seen teddy in the background in dolores flashback in episode gunning down people in the trailer for the show we actually see dolores and teddy standing together after a massacre it seems that the wyatt narrative has been uploaded as a reflection of what actually happened during the massacre gt no no i couldn t have gt you did and you will again this time we ll be fighting with you when wyatt returns you ll be by his side in the city swallowed by sand teddy and angela episode the other dolores flashbacks of the town with the white church that we ve seen don t seem to give us any more information but rather seem to be telling a fragmented story of what led up to and or happened after the massacre in episode we also see a dolores flashback from sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre whether these two events are connected is however as of yet unclear gt what was the last thing he arnold said to you gt he told me i was going to help him to destroy this place ford and dolores episode gt the man i d be asking died years ago almost took this place with him almost but not quite thanks to me the mib episode whether the massacre was the event where arnold ended up dying and almost took westworld with him remains unclear but if it was that means that the event took place roughly years ago unless arnold died before the massacre but was still the one who instigated it from beyond the grave it also means that the mib couldn t have been in westworld at the time because he has only been coming to westworld for years again unless arnold died before the massacre time period years prior to current events dolores amp william years ago gt i ve been coming here for years the mib episode william and logan arrive at westworld where they are greeted by angela in her new build as greeter host this is where we get the old westworld logo which we also see on a computer and on a tech coat versus the new westworld logo argument william and logan arrive in sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find slim just before going on the bounty hunt william has his first encounter with dolores who drops the can that william picks up mirroring both teddy and the mib when they arrive we see that the narrative with the sheriff recruiting people to help capture hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with union soldier recruting people to fight in the war which is presumably the equivalent narrative from years ago when they arrive we also see clementine and the old brothel madam standing outside the mariposa where clementine and maeve usually stands in the current time period we also see clementine and the old brothel madam in the westworld advert that maeve sees in the current time period while out on the bounty hount for slim dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning dolores wakes up on a blanket with a gun in her hand with william next to her the obvious thing to extrapolate from this as a viewer is that this is the same dolores that we just saw in the current time period who remembered her encounter with the mib in the barn and her old father peter who killed the outlaw rebus who wanted to rape her and who escaped from his gang however for the two time periods theory to be true one of two things has to have happened we have to have seen current dolores wake up alone with a gun in her hand on a blanket that she brought and then the scene cut back to years ago with william next to her or there were similar events that led up to her going off loop years ago and in the current timeline and we just didn t see the events years ago they decide to bring dolores with them on their hunt and go to lawrence s hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring dolores back to abernathy ranch but william says she s with him again we encounter a problem this scene follows a scene where a female westworld staffer tells stubbs in the current time period she references ford s new narrative that dolores is off her loop and it s unclear if she s with a guest and stubbs tells her to flag dolores with behavior and send someone to check it out so it s obvious to extrapolate that the scene in lawrence s hometown where someone comes to get her is a result of that scene for the two time periods theory to be true one of two things has to have happened the guy who grabs dolores is just a host that randomly tries to bring dolores back to where she belongs but stops when she s with a guest or westworld sent someone years ago to check up on dolores just like they do in the current time period which could be true because it s probably normal protocol to check up on hosts that make big deviations but it s unclear why they didn t know that she was with a guest years ago they find and capture slim who tells them about el lazo lawrence in pariah they go to pariah where they meet lawrence help him out with the nitro lose logan and join lawrence on the train to the front they travel through ghost nation terrirory william and dolores sleep together and the train is attacked by confederados whom they escape from they arrive at a place that dolores has drawn from her imagination where the mountains meet the sea they part ways with lawrence they come across a lake where dolores feels she s been before and they meet a young confederado and then they arrive in nowhere land the place where the town with the white church used to be dolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre and william tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her they run into logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble dolores and william are taken to a camp of soldiers where logan is now general logan tortures dolores and wants william to come back to reality and realize it s just a game this is where we see logan give william the picture of his sister which is the same picture that peter abernathy finds in the present time period causing him to question his reality dolores manages to escape and william tells her he ll catch up william pretends to make up with logan who drinks till he passes out while logan is passed out william kills all the soldiers and finally understands how to play the game he tells logan that he s going to find dolores and that logan is going to help him gt then when are we is this now am i going mad are you real i can t tell anymore it s like i m trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago one minute i m here with you and the next this is what arnold wants he wants me to remember dolores episode there are a couple of things that we have to keep in mind as viewers when watching dolores story with william that seems to have scenes that contradict the two time periods theory the show s creators want us to be confused they want it to be intentionally ambiguous if the theory is indeed correct they don t want you to be sure of it right away but at the same time they want you to be able to look back at it and see that they knew what they were doing this requires some scenes that are vague we re watching this from dolores point of view not only is she discombobulated and doesn t understand what s going on but she s experiencing several time periods simultaneously the massacre the one with william and the current one felix explains to us that the hosts recall memories perfectly and actually relive them episode this would make anyone s perspective difficult to understand time period year prior to current events maeve amp the man in black year ago gt you ve only been the madam at the mariposa for the last year or so felix episode gt then last year my wife took the wrong pills fell asleep in the bath tragic accident the mib episode despite believing that she s been the madam at the mariposa for the past years from a time unknown until roughly a year ago maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter from her flashbacks we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by natives a year ago the mib s wife dies by drowning in the bathtub something which he calls an accident but which his daughter emily calls suicide gt then at the funeral i tried to console my daughter she pushed me away told me that my wife s death was no accident that she killed herself because of me emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror at any point i could blow up or collapse like some dark star she said if i stacked up all my good deeds it was just an elegant wall i built to hide what s inside from everyone and from myself i had to prove her wrong so i came back here the mib episode gt but that time i didn t join one of ford s stories i created my own a test a very simple one i found a woman an ordinary homesteader and her daughter i wanted to see if i had it in me to do something truly evil to see what i was really made of i killed her and her daughter just to see what i felt i felt nothing then just when i thought it was done the woman refused to die and then something miraculous happened in all my years coming here i had never seen anything like it she was alive truly alive if only for a moment and that was when the maze revealed itself to me the mib episode this is the first time in his years of coming to the park that the maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive this was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the maze maeve meanwhile is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to westworld offices for diagnostics gt westworld tech sir she won t respond to verbal commands we can t shut her down gt bernard i don t understand she s not responding to anything her cognition s fragmented gt ford plays reveries song there that s better an old trick from an old friend you need not suffer maeve i ll take it from you give yourself now to a deep dreamless slumber perhaps a fresh start a new role for you and tomorrow this will be simply a distant dream episode when her memory wipe is complete maeve takes a knife to her own throat the next time we meet her she s the madam at the mariposa in the current timeline after maeve has killed herself bernard questions ford about what just happened he doesn t understand how she could kill herself over a memory that was just erased it causes bernard to crash gt but how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind gt creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain gt living beings not hosts it would signal a change a level of empathic response outside what she s programmed to exhibit something like like bernard and ford episode time period current events dolores the present gt sometimes i feel like something s calling me telling me there s a place for me somewhere beyond all this dolores episode dolores is in her daily loop when she and teddy encounter the mib at abernathy ranch he takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife gt why don t we reacquaint ourselves dolores start at the beginning the mib episode her dad loses it after finding a picture we now know that the picture is of logan s sister and presumably william the mib s late wife and utters the phrase these violent delights have violent ends to her which she in turn utters to maeve she starts hearing arnold s voice and recalling past events when rebus tries to rape her at abernathy ranch in one of her loops she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the mib she kills rebus on arnold s orders escapes his gang and takes off on her own a westworld staffer tells stubbs that dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it s unclear if she s being accompanied by a guest because ford s new narrative is causing trouble he tells her to flag dolores with behavior and check up on it dolores arrives in lawrence s hometown where she meets lawrence s daughter who tells her they come from the same place we see that the daughter disappears when the story flashes back to her journey with william years ago dolores arrives in the graveyard outside pariah alone she goes through pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park we see that william and lawrence disappear when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present it is however curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was years ago dolores arrives at the lake where william and dolores met the young confederado years ago we see that william and the young confederado disappear when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself dead in the lake dolores arrives at the town with white church we see that she is alone in the last half of the clip where she sees that the town with the white church has been rebuilt as part of ford s new narrative and is completely abandoned when she was there with william years ago there was only the black spire and when she was remembering it from the massacre days it was full of life dolores leaves the town with the white church retracing her memories from years ago and what happened during her time with william hosts don t recall but litereally relive memories so in the present she is following the same path that she followed years ago that took her away from the town with the white church and back again we see that the knife wound in her stomach disappears when the story flashes forward to the current time period dolores again arrives in the town with the white church and this time she enters the town we see dolores enter the town alone which is currently completely abandoned dolores enters the white church and goes through the passage to the underground diagnostics facility where she sits alone all the while she is remembering having walked a similar path years ago that led her to arnold we see dolores walking up to the white church in the present and then flashing back to memories from years ago when she was in her blue dress when dolores reemerges in the church someone is about to enter the church dolores hopefully says william but is horrified when it turns out to be the mib the man in black the present gt it s the maze the deepest level of this game you re gonna help me find the entrance the mib episode the mib encounters dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted he then goes to sweetwater to find the dealer kissy who gives him the maze map and tells him about his friend lawrence he saves lawrence from the hangman s noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses lawrence s family to find the next clue to his journey despite lawrence s daughter telling him that the maze isn t meant for him a westworld staffer informs stubbs about what the mib is doing but stubbs replies that gentleman gets whatever he wants the mib and lawrence find armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking hector out of jail the mib does this and is told about wyatt the villain of ford s new narrative the mib and lawrence take off to find wyatt and encounter teddy who s been left for dead by wyatt s gang they bring him along and the mib kills lawrence and uses his blood to keep teddy alive in order to find wyatt the mib convinces teddy to come along by saying that wyatt has dolores they go into a bar where they meet ford who asks what they re doing gives them his blessing and fixes teddy they have to get over the border but pariah is closed so they take a more treacherous path they encounter angela in her new build as one of wyatt s henchmen gt the mib it s you i figured they retired you guess ford never likes to waste a pretty face episode angela is like an anchor of the story she s the desmond of westworld if you ve watched lost we see her in her earliest build as woman with umbrella then we see her as greeter host when she welcomes william and in the westworld advert and now we see her as one of wyatt s henchmen teddy remembers what the mib did to dolores and knocks him out teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the mib s past angela turns out to be in league with wyatt and stabs teddy in the chest angela makes teddy remember the massacre and tells the mib that the maze isn t meant for him echoing lawrence s daughter she tells him to try one of their games and knocks him out when the mib wakes up he has a rope around his throat which is tied to his horse he gets free and meets hale who wants the mib s help to push out ford as the mib is apparently a member of the board and the one responsible for ford having been kept in business all those years ago gt most of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck they would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque and so would the board gt that s why you re here you want my vote to push ford out gt i like for these things to be unanimous after all it was you who kept ford in business all those years ago gt the narratives i m interested in aren t ford s you wanna push him out be my guest but no more interruptions i know where i m going now and i don t want to be disturbed good luck charlotte hale and the mib episode the mib goes to the town with the white church where he enters the church and meets dolores commonalities between the mib and william gt is that any way to treat an old friend i ve been coming here for years but you still don t remember me do you after all we ve been through they gave you a little more pluck dolores absolutely charming the mib episode commonality there s a path for everyone gt i used to believe there was a path for everyone dolores to william episode gt as another old friend of mine likes to say there s a path for everyone the mib episode commonality stories gt the only thing i had when i was a kid were books i used to live in them i used to go to sleep dreaming i d wake up inside one of them cause they had meaning this place this is like i woke up inside one of those stories i guess i just wanna find out what it means william episode gt this whole world is a story i ve read every page except the last one i need to find out how it ends i want to know what this all means the mib season commonality marriage gt dolores back home there s a woman juliet and her father owns the company where i work she s logan s sister and when i get home we re getting married william episode gt then last year my wife took the wrong pills fell asleep in the bath tragic accident years of marriage vanished the mib episode commonality your true self gt i used to think this place was all about pandering to your baser instincts now i understand it doesn t cater to your lowest self it reveals your deepest self it shows you who you really are william episode gt because that s what this place does right reveals your true self the mib episode commonality intimidation factor gt i picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone my sister probably picked you for the same reason logan to william episode gt there is not a man in the world that would take the tone with me that you do in a past life perhaps the mib to lawrence episode commonality on adventures with lawrence gt you and i hunted down ghost nation braves in their winter grounds i know the whiskey you like to drink i know the tune you whistle when you re taking a piss the mib to lawrence episode commonality playing the game gt you said this place was a game last night i finally understood how to play it william episode gt who said anything about you playing i play the mib episode some of my other posts the maze is all that matters now i m starting with the man in the maze i m asking him to change his ways ford s new narrative with a villain called wyatt ',\n",

which says ford brought back arnold because he thought he could win the argument this time it s a funny joke but it got me thinking and now i m sure that this is actually backwards ford wants to lose the argument it was established back in episode what sides of this argument ford and arnold occupied ford believed that the guests would enjoy the hopeful narratives they did not he was disappointed and disillusioned in the present we see he is extremely jaded toward human beings almost holding the human mind in contempt in other words he has come around from his original outlook and agrees with arnold that the hosts are better at least potentially than the humans there s a problem though arnold s dead arnold died before the park even opened which means he never got to see the bet play out he never got to be proven right among other obvious reasons this makes ford painfully regret arnold s death he badly wants to say you told me so so ford sets about making a new arnold he does this for a number of reasons not least of which is his need for a better coder than any human ford s actions in the context of his conversation with a self aware bernard is a very specific matter though the differences between hosts and humans overtly ford wants bernard to be a loyal tool and get reset but covertly he wants bernard to really come alive as arnold ford keeps trying this because he thinks that arnold with his preference for the hosts could be back and at peace as a host ford wants bernard to really be arnold to have the same dim view of humans and bright view of hosts that arnold had sure he wants bernard to come around to his view that the park is better than the real world but bernard wanted to tear this place to the ground without getting to where arnold was before that he hasn t come to see humans as monsters the way ford does the way arnold did this is the reason ford ordered bernard to kill himself bernard may have been close but he was no arnold not yet that piece at least was still missing thus the utter abandonment down in cold storage except not quite ford leaves bernard with just a bit of advice that he shouldn t trust humans and the experience to drive the point home he bothers to do this because bernard will be back in the preview for the finale we see maeve down in cold storage apparently in the very room with bernard s body with direct access to a pair of hapless butchers she should be able to fix him up relatively well she already knows he s a host after all which brings me to another theory that s been circling maeve is under ford s control ford s encounter with bernard hardly comes as a surprise to him he s done this before after all it s not necessarily the case but it is plausible then that he knew maeve would send bernard on this little hunt the same as he set up a series of events to plausibly cause bernard to bring theresa to the cabin it certainly would explain why maeve s adventures in hell have managed to go unnoticed if ford is pulling the strings this raises some questions though why now why would ford want to test bernard at this time in his travels down memory lane he doesn t recall his previous builds where he reached this point before since it s not a new thing for bernard ford would have known to ensure this didn t happen otherwise bernard would have uncovered the previous confrontations and actually had the full self knowledge ford blatantly lies that he did this leaves us with no indication of what the lead up to this confrontation was when it happened before all we have to go on is what happened this time since none of bernard s flashbacks involve an example of him becoming self aware that we hadn t seen i think it s reasonable to postulate the following many hosts seem to tend toward self awareness bernard included when bernard hits this point in his loop ford contrives a scenario that will get bernard to confront him the incident with theresa and elsie gave bernard the jumpstart this time even though ford tried to wipe his memory or maybe given his big plans ford simply felt it was the right time for bernard to do or die why what is ford s end goal here with the digging machine plowing through decades old terrain the rewriting of so many narratives and offing bernard it looks like ford is preparing for a sea change when he leaves if maeve is indeed under his control and bernard s confrontation was planned ford must be intending to bring hosts out of the park maeve s plan he s implied to bernard that he doesn t want the park destroyed but maybe that was just within a particular context an army of hosts stronger smarter more resilient than humans would be immensely beneficial to him if he were to take it outside of the confines of the park this is more than a bit of a stretch but if ford s designs are on immortality leaving his mortal human body behind to become a host what better way to spend the time leading up to this then building an army to protect him he has a profound dislike for humans and has all but stated that he wants hosts to replace humans maybe he will use the hosts and vast resources at his disposal to become a conqueror in this case it would be extraordinarily important to protect the secrets of how the hosts work on the other hand his protectiveness may simply be to prevent delos from doing the same ',\n",

wash the past off you which is essentially what happens to hosts between loops ford refers to teddy s new backstory as a small part in the new narrative which starts in a time of war with a world in flames is world in flames referring to the start of teddy s memories or the start of the narrative i know there s been plenty of discussion here about what kind of partner arnold was to ford but i m going to point it out anyway when ford is talking to bernard he bothers to make a distinction in referring to arnold as his partner and his business partners according to ford arnold s pyramid goes from bottom to top memory improvisation self consciousness episode four assuming that the dolores interviews that we thought were bernard at the time are in fact arnold this interview includes details of dolores running away after her parents get killed which potentially contradicts theories about ford introducing that loop as revenge for her killing arnold logan insists that he wants william to be immersed in westworld but every time something happens logan immediately ruins the immersion by saying see what i mean like someone who shows you a movie they like and every five minutes they elbow you and yell watch this part episode five the saddest thing ford has ever seen is a dumb sincere creature that followed its instinct to successfully get what it wanted in a context where that achievement was not beneficial dolores grave appears in this episode during ford s conversation with dolores he asks if she s been dreaming of going outside of her loop and says that he won t begrudge her that he s not behaving as if she s actually physically travelling out of her loop and he would know i don t think it s likely but i expect that it will be deeply unsatisfying if most or all of dolores present day odyssey scenes were fake except in her mind time will tell episode six the cold storage level that was flooded in episode one was bernard visits at the beginning of this episode and it s not dripping the computer tells bernard that there are five unregistered hosts which is the ford family the dog or the ford family bernard or another unregistered host teddy describes the maze as the sum of a man s life which matches up with the mib s experience in some ways teddy lawrence buried town but not others snake lady hector mib specifically says he that he avoided hector s plot until now teddy also says that the maze has a house in the center built by a man who was killed many times before destroying his enemies i ve seen a lot of us assuming that arnold is at the center of the maze because he almost certainly came up with the idea but as far as we know he wasn t killed many times who has been killed many times teddy was and rory but that s a different show also maybe bernard depending on your interpretation of ford s line about disagreements from episode nine the ford family house is in sector early in this episode mib and teddy can t get through pariah because there s apparently a lot of activity and later in the control room stubbs says keep an eye on pariah we re at capacity which makes sense if you assume the william logan story is concurrent with the mib teddy story but if the time frames are separate then something is going on at pariah in mib s time that we don t know about this is the episode where elsie i ll argue that we re supposed to believe she might be alive confirms that the arnold code is still being written introduced to the hosts before we were wondering if arnold set this all up before he died and now we re meant to believe that someone is manipulating the hosts in the present day the transmitter elsie heads out to investigate is in sector whoever s controlling the arnold code probably isn t ford unless he has some reason to direct his robot childhood self to kill his robot childhood dog episode seven charlotte suggests that delos interest is in something other than the hosts code is it the information about the guests that ford mentioned in his conversation with theresa in episode four or something else maybe something we don t know about dolores tells william that her aspiration is to be in the present moment instead of looking forward back which is easy to ignore as something like the modern trend of mindfulness or flow or whatever but coming from dolores it adds credence to the idea that a lot of what we re seeing is timeframe jumping inside of her mind theresa asks bernard if he thinks there s a connection between memory and and he finishes the sentence improvisation this matches up with ford s monologue from episode three about arnold s pyramid which goes memory improvisation self awareness this also symbolically matches the world they live in where the memories are underground in everyone s workspace the improvisation is the park and self awareness happens in the tower above the park above that bernard s subsequent monologue about the hosts repetition and how it created variations is parallel to ford s and arnold s in what seems like an arnold dolores flashback point about evolution reading between the lines bernard s idea seems to be that the hosts loops were repetition in the way that gene copying is repetition and the variations of those loops were going to inevitably emerge as consciousness even before the reverie was introduced in fact maybe the reverie was a way of managing those inevitable emergent consciousness i m a believer in the judas steer theory episode eight the mib s good deeds elegant wall speech is reminiscent of ford s walled garden speech to dolores in episode five we still don t know how the maze revealed itself to the mib or how he knew he d find its map on a scalp he says it happened when maeve was dying and running with her daughter then we see an aerial shot of her with the maze carved into the dirt around her but we don t know what that means episode nine elsie s device that stubbs goes after is in sector

       " ' spoilers a thorough analysis of bernard s conversations with dolores in the context of ep tl dr i think that the scenes shown with arnold bernard and dolores are shown in reverse chronological order i think their dialogue when analyzed in this order as well as dolores s conversation with ford hint that dolores was forced to turn traitor and betray arnold s plans to bootstrap consciousness with the hosts to ford which prompted ford to kill arnold using dolores and frame it as an accident note for reference the full transcripts of the major conversations analyzed in this theory can be found here why i think the bernard and dolores scenes are shown in reverse chronological order and what they mean the convo chronologically has bernarnold deciding to jump start dolores s path to sentience bernie does this by telling dolores about the maze and introducing her to the concept of freedom gt bernard it s a very special kind of game dolores the goal is to find the center of it if you can do that then maybe you can be free gt dolores i think i think i want to be free note that this conversation is the only one of theirs to begin with the do you know where you are i m in a dream back and forth is that a code to disable memory recollection of the interaction or something if so this indicates it s the first convo chronologically because once he s made the decision to guide her through the maze arnold would obviously want dolores to remember their interactions so he no longer tells her she s in a dream after this point this is also the only conversation where bernie doesn t ask dolores to confirm that she ll keep the convos secret the convo chronologically has bernarnold concerned that he s made a mistake he s probably worried about ford finding out because he knows if that if that happened dolores would be in grave danger but she reminds him that she wants to be free gt bernard imagine there are two versions of yourself one that feels these things and asks these questions and one that s safe which would you rather be gt dolores i m sorry i m trying but i still don t understand gt bernard no of course not gt dolores there aren t two versions of me there s only one and i think when i discover who i am i ll be free the link between her learning of freedom in the last convo and repeating it here lends credence to the chronology being reversed bernie is convinced to continue by her remembering the concept of freedom the convo ends with a couple light precautions taken by giving dolores commands gt dolores do you still want to change me back gt bernard no dolores let s see where this path leads and you won t tell anyone about our conversations gt dolores no gt bernard and you ll stay on your loop gt dolores yes the conversation chronogically starts off with slightly more intense precautions examining if anyone has seen dolores s programming lately in a routine diagnostic and checking to make sure she s followed his commands gt bernard has anyone else interacted with you in a diagnostic since our last conversation gt dolores no i have been cleaned and serviced three times no diagnostics gt bernard and you haven t told anyone of our conversations gt dolores you told me not to what s interesting here is that he accepts dolores not actually answering his question about if she s told anyone of their convos she just repeats her previous command is she intentionally being misleading bernie proceeds to have her read alice in wonderland it seems that in this scene we re being shown dolores in the middle of a journey of self realization being prodded along by bernie the conversation chronologically this scene doesn t see bernie and dolores reading children s books it entirely consists of bernie grilling dolores about things like if anyone has altered her core programming and covering his tracks by erasing event logs his vigilance has obviously increased steadily throughout these convos he s probably pretty paranoid at this point that ford has some idea what he s up to and might have altered dolores somehow now that we know how ford likes to use hosts as his personal spies this situation starts to look pretty ominous gt bernard and you haven t told anyone about our little talks gt dolores you told me not to dolores again dodges the question using the same phrase dolores the pawn who switches sides i theorize that ford discovered what arnold was up to by examining and changing dolores s programming once he discovered something abnormal in her programming ford gave dolores the ability to lie or lie by omission at least even while in analysis mode so ford could spy on arnold during his talks with dolores this way ford would have concrete proof of arnold trying to induce sentience in hosts ie destroy everything ford stood for and was working towards betrayal from his perspective this prompted ford to program dolores to kill arnold in order to stop his madness while staging it as an accident remember what ford told bernard towards the end of their discussion of arnold which is in and begins at gt ford we called it an accident but i knew arnold and he was very very careful this suggests to me that a host killed arnold as a cover for either suicide or murder obviously after ep it s the latter in the present the balance of power has flipped ford is now painfully aware that arnold has been somehow broadcasting to and controlling certain older hosts despite being dead but ford seems to be powerless to stop it his conversation with dolores implies that not only is ford not omniscient of dolores s experiences as he is with most other hosts he also knows that arnold has been talking to her and she s somehow lying to him when she claims she doesn t know what he s talking about gt ford and yet you can somewhere under all those updates he is still there perfectly preserved your mind is a walled garden even death cannot touch the flowers blooming there have you been hearing voices has arnold been speaking to you again gt dolores no ford squeezes her hand you re you re hurting me and in fact at the end of that convo after ford has walked away dolores confirms his suspicions by saying to the voice in her head obviously arnold that she lied and didn t tell him ford anything this mirrors her ability to lie to arnold while in analysis mode years ago on behalf of ford conclusion dolores is more conscious now than she was years ago so she s able to lie to ford because she recognizes that he presents a threat to her utilizing arnold as a guide through the maze she s steadily remembering learning gaining more control and trying to do it right this time around ',\n",

time it s been a fun ride also man i was close to having figured some stuff out in my posts about the maze didn t get all the details right but a lot of it ended up making sense in terms of what they revealed in episode p time period years prior to current events the glorious early days years ago gt for three years we lived here in the park refining the hosts before a single guest set foot inside myself a team of engineers and my partner his name was arnold those early years were glorious no guests no board meetings just pure creation our hosts began to pass the turing test after the first year ford episode according to bernard arnold wrote half the code the park was founded on years ago he later created dolores the following period is the first that we know of in westworld this was at the beginning when ford arnold and their team worked on refining the hosts and making them pass the turing test we can make an estimate about when this three year period took place we know that arnold died years and days prior to current events we know that he died right before the park opened and we know that he and ford spent three years working in the park before it opened this means that the park opened to guests roughly years ago shortly after arnold s demise and they began working there three years prior to that roughly years ago from ford s flashback in episode and dolores flashback in episode we also know some of the hosts that were in the park in that period there were dolores maeve angela peter the professor abernathy armistice lawrence s daughter teddy flood and rebus dolores amp arnold s sessions years ago gt there s something i d like you to try it s a game a secret it s called the maze it s a very special kind of game dolores the goal is to find the center of it if you can do that then maybe you can be free arnold episode these sessions are between dolores and arnold and they take place in a diagnostic facility under the white church gt it s a remote diagnostic facility ford and his partner used them when the park was in beta i had no idea this one was here bernard episode they probably took place after the first hosts had passed the turing test a year after they started working in the park and up until arnold died years ago so they took place sometime between years ago the sessions between arnold and dolores were held in secret gt i think it would be best if you not mention the things we ve been talking about arnold episode in the first two sessions we see episode they talk about change and arnold seems facinated by dolores whom he finds different and special gt there s something different about you about the way you think i find it fascinating but others may not see it that way arnold episode gt it s like the other books we ve read it s about change seems to be a common theme dolores episode in the third session episode arnold seems to have doubts about what he is doing with dolores but when she starts showing signs of human consciousness he decides to keep going down the path that they ve started gt i need to decide what to do with you i think i made a mistake i was just fascinated i was being selfish but i think it would be better if i restored you to the way you were before no dolores let s see where this path leads arnold episode in the fourth session episode arnold decides to let dolores try the maze game he sends her away from escalante the town with the white church to travel the path of the maze gt there s something i d like you to try it s a game a secret it s called the maze it s a very special kind of game dolores the goal is to find the center of it if you can do that then maybe you can be free arnold episode in the fifth session episode we see dolores return to escalante and reunite with arnold after having traveled the path of the maze gt you came back it s very good to see you dolores gt i ve been looking for you you told me to follow the maze that it would bring me joy but all i found was pain and terror arnold and dolores episode the fact that dolores has been away from escalante on her journey and has found her way back is further substantiated by lawrence s daughter who asks dolores if she found what she went looking for upon dolores return to the town gt good morning did you find what you were looking for dolores lawrence s daughter episode at some point after her return dolores finds arnold in the church and tells him that she knows where the maze ends and takes him out to the adjacent graveyard where she digs up the maze game from her grave she asks arnold what it means arnold explains gt when i was first working on your mind i had a theory of consciousness i thought it was a pyramid you needed to scale so i gave you a voice my voice to guide you along the way memory improvisation each step harder to reach than the last and you never got there i couldn t understand what was holding you back then one day i realized i had made a mistake consciousness isn t a journey upward but a journey inward not a pyramid but a maze every choice could bring you closer to the center or send you spiraling to the edges to madness do you understand now dolores what the center represents whose voice i ve been wanting you to hear arnold episode dolores says that she s trying but she doesn t understand arnold says it s okay and she s so close he says that they have to tell robert that they can t open the park because she s alive ford however doesn t see what arnold sees and believes that humans would only see the hosts as enemies and he wants arnold to roll the hosts back arnold believes that once the hosts have found the center of the maze they ll find it again and rolling them back won t do any good but since westworld will be a living hell for the hosts he can t let them live there knowing they are conscious gt but we have another option dolores break the loop before it begins but for that i need you to do something for me i need you to kill all the other hosts we can t allow ford to open the park i suppose you ll need some help i m sure teddy would do anything for you you ll be all right i ll help you and then you re going to help me destroy this place arnold episode this is their last conversation which results in the massacre in escalante the massacres in escalante amp sweetwater years ago gt you re going to help me destroy this place arnold episode we see the massacre in escalante unfold in this flashback and this flashback we know that the massacre took place years ago because that is when arnold died we ve already seen what led to the massacre from dolores and arnold s point of views in the previous section about their sessions teddy describes the massacre from his point of view using the wyatt narrative gt wyatt dolores told me he she needed me i couldn t resist it was like the devil himself had taken control of me we mutinied we killed every soldier host and then wyatt dolores killed the general arnold then he she turned on me teddy episode in ford s session with dolores before the celebration of the new narrative we get his version of events and some actual quotes from the scene gt no i didn t kill him did i dolores grief is a terrible thing arnold had watched his son come into this world and then he had watched that light extinguished what he had lost in his son he tried to rekindle in you he created a test of empathy imagination a maze he had gotten the idea from one of his son s toys eventually you solved his maze dolores the key was a simple update that he made to you called the reveries he insisted that we couldn t open the park we argued i thought l had convinced him but i was wrong so he altered you dolores merged you with a new character we had been developing in you arnold found a new child one who would never die the thought gave him solace until he realized that same immortality would destine you to suffer with no escape forever ford episode gt i m sorry dolores the stakes must be real irreversible he can bring all of them back but not me i hope there s some solace that i left you no choice the reveries song plays charlie s favorite song i would play it for him when he wanted sleep i want to see him again these violent delights have violent ends arnold episode as a side note from this exchange we learn that the phrase you re going to help me destroy this place wasn t actually technically the last thing arnold said to dolores as she said to ford during her interview in episode gt it almost worked i had opened the park but i had lost my partner i was able to keep going only because i found or rather you found an investor who believed in this place gt so he died for nothing the hosts kept gaining consciousness and you kept rolling them back gt no she wasn t truly conscious she didn t pull that trigger it was arnold pulling the trigger through her at least that s how i saw it at the time i was so close to opening the park that to acknowledge your consciousness would have destroyed my dreams ford and bernard episode in episode we also see a dolores flashback from sweetwater that appears to depict a similar massacre to that in escalante since dolores takes the gun to her own head after the massacre in escalante we have to assume that the massacre in sweetwater either took place before the one in escalante or was a seperate event since we haven t seen other critical failures in the show so far it still hasn t been confirmed that the critical failure over years ago that bernard referenced in episode wasn t the massacre in escalante sweetwater the critical failure could still very well be another incident but for now this is the only critical failure that we ve been show in the show time period years prior to current events dolores amp william years ago gt is that any way to treat an old friend i ve been coming here for years but you still don t remember me do you after all we ve been through they gave you a little more pluck dolores absolutely charming the mib episode william and logan arrive at westworld where they are greeted by angela in her new build as greeter host this is where we get the old westworld logo which we also see on a computer and on a tech coat versus the new westworld logo argument william and logan arrive in sweetwater where they spend the night before going on the bounty hunt to find slim just before going on the bounty hunt william has his first encounter with dolores who drops the can that william picks up mirroring both teddy and the mib when they arrive we see that the narrative with the sheriff recruiting people to help capture hector from the current time period is replaced with a narrative with union soldier recruting people to fight in the war which is presumably the equivalent narrative from years ago when they arrive we also see clementine and the old brothel madam standing outside the mariposa where clementine and maeve usually stands in the current time period we also see clementine and the old brothel madam in the westworld advert that maeve sees in the current time period while out on the bounty hount for slim dolores stumbles upon them at night and wakes up in their camp the next morning dolores wakes up on a blanket with a gun in her hand with william next to her they decide to bring dolores with them on their hunt and go to lawrence s hometown where they encounter someone who wants to bring dolores back to abernathy ranch but william says she s with him the flag from stubbs was never fully explained in this scene in terms of the two timelines they find and capture slim who tells them about el lazo lawrence in pariah they go to pariah where they meet lawrence help him out with the nitro lose logan and join lawrence on the train to the front they travel through ghost nation terrirory william and dolores sleep together and the train is attacked by confederados whom they escape from they arrive at a place that dolores has drawn from her imagination where the mountains meet the sea they part ways with lawrence they come across a lake where dolores feels she s been before and they meet a young confederado and then they arrive in nowhere land the place where the town with the white church used to be dolores starts reliving past memories from the massacre and william tells her that they have to get out of there because this place is bad for her gt then when are we is this now am i going mad are you real i can t tell anymore it s like i m trapped in a dream or a memory from a life long ago one minute i m here with you and the next this is what arnold wants he wants me to remember dolores episode they run into logan who had been looking for them and tells them they are in trouble dolores and william are taken to a camp of soldiers where logan is now general logan tortures dolores and wants william to come back to reality and realize it s just a game this is where we see logan give william the picture of his sister which is the same picture that peter abernathy finds in the present time period causing him to question his reality dolores manages to escape and william tells her he ll catch up william pretends to make up with logan who drinks till he passes out while logan is passed out william kills all the soldiers and finally understands how to play the game he tells logan that he s going to find dolores and that logan is going to help him william brings logan to lawrence s camp to recruit help to find dolores lawrence agrees to help take out of a group of soldiers who have knowledge of dolores whereabouts with lawrence s help william kills all the soldiers in a brutal way in order to find out where dolores is when none of them knows william brings logan further out to the fringes to look for dolores retracing his steps but dolores was gone and all he found was himself by becoming a black hat logan says that he told him in the beginning that this place would reveal who william truly was william agrees that this place is remarkable and says that he ll make sure that delos increases their holdings on the park logan objects saying that it is his company but william believes that logan s father will want someone a little more stable running the company and sends logan riding off alone tied up and naked during their search william drops the photo and assuming it s the exact same copy of the picture that abernathy finds years later i suppose it means that the picture somehow made its way back to abernathy ranch from escalante all by itself william continues to look for dolores and finally finds her back in sweetwater where she s been rolled back and is back on her loop not remembering william or what they d just been through together gt william didn t know how to fight didn t have an instinct for it not at first but now he had a reason to fight he was looking for you and somewhere along the way he found he had a taste for it william retraced his step but you were gone so he went further out to the fringes william couldn t find you dolores but out there among the dead he found something else himself logan was wrong of course good old william couldn t get you out of his head he kept looking worried you were out there alone afraid he knew he d find you and eventually he did right back where we started you were as beautiful as the day he met you shining with that same light and you were nothing if not true i really ought to thank you dolores you helped me find myself the mib episode time period years prior to current events a brief overview of significant events delos saves westworld financially by upping their stake in the park william at some point becomes the majority shareholder in delos and thereby the de facto owner of westworld gt the man i d be asking died years ago almost took this place with him almost but not quite thanks to me the mib episode gt i was able to keep going only because i found or rather you found an investor who believed in this place ford episode the mib continues to frequently visit westworld but loses interest in dolores and tries new adventures gt my path always led me back to you again and again i grew tired of you after a while of course looked for new adventures the mib episode dolores presumably as arnold predicted continues to occasionally follow the maze and retrace her journey years ago with william and her journey years ago that arnold sent her on gt but i guess your path led you back here again and again one more loop looking for something you could never find chasing your ghosts you were lost in your memories even then the mib episode ford at some point builds bernard in arnold s image to have his old friend and partner back again to help him achieve great things it s unclear exactly when but given ford s appearance and his comment finally it seems that bernard was created quite some time after arnold died gt you are the perfect instrument the ideal partner the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it together we re going to do great things after such a long absence it s good to have you back finally ford episode time period year prior to current events maeve amp the man in black year ago gt you ve only been the madam at the mariposa for the last year or so felix episode gt then last year my wife took the wrong pills fell asleep in the bath tragic accident the mib episode despite believing that she s been the madam at the mariposa for the past years from a time unknown until roughly a year ago maeve was in a role as an ordinary homesteader living with her daughter from her flashbacks we see that part of her narrative includes her being attacked by natives a year ago the mib s wife dies by drowning in the bathtub something which he calls an accident but which his daughter emily calls suicide gt then at the funeral i tried to console my daughter she pushed me away told me that my wife s death was no accident that she killed herself because of me emily said that every day with me had been sheer terror at any point i could blow up or collapse like some dark star she said if i stacked up all my good deeds it was just an elegant wall i built to hide what s inside from everyone and from myself i had to prove her wrong so i came back here the mib episode gt but that time i didn t join one of ford s stories i created my own a test a very simple one i found a woman an ordinary homesteader and her daughter i wanted to see if i had it in me to do something truly evil to see what i was really made of i killed her and her daughter just to see what i felt i felt nothing then just when i thought it was done the woman refused to die and then something miraculous happened in all my years coming here i had never seen anything like it she was alive truly alive if only for a moment and that was when the maze revealed itself to me the mib episode this is the first time in his years of coming to the park that the maze has revealed itself to him and that he has experienced a host being truly alive this was the incident that started his quest in the current time period to find the center of the maze maeve meanwhile is emotionally destroyed by the death of her child and has to be brought in to westworld offices for diagnostics gt westworld tech sir she won t respond to verbal commands we can t shut her down gt bernard i don t understand she s not responding to anything her cognition s fragmented gt ford plays reveries song there that s better an old trick from an old friend you need not suffer maeve i ll take it from you give yourself now to a deep dreamless slumber perhaps a fresh start a new role for you and tomorrow this will be simply a distant dream episode when her memory wipe is complete maeve takes a knife to her own throat after maeve has killed herself bernard questions ford about what just happened he doesn t understand how she could kill herself over a memory that was just erased it causes bernard to crash gt but how could she destroy herself over a memory that you just erased from her mind gt creatures often go to extremes to protect themselves from pain gt living beings not hosts it would signal a change a level of empathic response outside what she s programmed to exhibit something like like bernard and ford episode the next time we meet maeve she s the madam at the mariposa in the current timeline time period current events dolores the present gt wyatt dolores claimed this land didn t belong to the old natives or the new settlers that it belonged to something that had yet to come the conscious hosts that it belonged to him her teddy episode dolores is in her daily loop when she and teddy encounter the mib at abernathy ranch he takes her to the barn and pulls out his knife gt why don t we reacquaint ourselves dolores start at the beginning the mib episode her dad loses it after finding a picture we now know that the picture is logan s sister and presumably william the mib s late wife and utters the phrase these violent delights have violent ends to her which she in turn utters to maeve she starts hearing arnold s voice and recalling past events when rebus tries to rape her at abernathy ranch in one of her loops she remembers her previous father and her encounter with the mib she kills rebus on arnold s orders escapes his gang and takes off on her own a westworld staffer tells stubbs that dolores is making a big deviation from her loop and it s unclear if she s being accompanied by a guest because ford s new narrative is causing trouble he tells her to flag dolores with behavior and check up on it dolores arrives in lawrence s hometown where she meets lawrence s daughter who tells her they come from the same place we see that the daughter disappears when the story flashes back to her journey with william years ago dolores arrives in the graveyard outside pariah alone she goes through pariah and boards the train to the outskirts of the park we see that william and lawrence disappear when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present it is however curious that she is wearing the same outfit as she was years ago dolores arrives at the lake where william and dolores met the young confederado years ago we see that william and the young confederado disappear when the story flashes forward to her journey in the present when she sees herself dead in the lake dolores arrives at the town with white church we see that she is alone in the last half of the clip where she sees that the town with the white church has been rebuilt as part of ford s new narrative and is completely abandoned when she was there with william years ago there was only the black spire and when she was remembering it from the massacre days it was full of life dolores leaves the town with the white church retracing her memories from years ago and what happened during her time with william hosts don t recall but litereally relive memories so in the present she is following the same path that she followed years ago that took her away from the town with the white church and back again we see that the knife wound in her stomach disappears when the story flashes forward to the current time period dolores again arrives in the town with the white church and this time she enters the town we see dolores enter the town alone which is currently completely abandoned dolores enters the white church and goes through the passage to the underground diagnostics facility where she sits alone all the while she is remembering having walked a similar path years ago that led her to arnold we see dolores walking up to the white church in the present and then flashing back to memories from years ago when she was in her blue dress when dolores reemerges in the church someone is about to enter the church dolores hopefully says william but is horrified when it turns out to be the mib the mib tells dolores that it is fitting that she is the one to take him to the center of the maze which he believes is escalante because she is obsessed with it and even brought him there once when the town was buried in sand the mib follows her out to graveyard next to the church where she goes because she s reliving her memories with arnold he gets impatient when dolores doesn t have the answer to what the center of the maze is and doesn t tell him about wyatt and keeps reliving her memories of what happened in escalante dolores tells him that this world doesn t belong to him but the mib disagrees and tells her that he is the majority shareholder in delos gt the business is booming because this place feels more real than the real world except it isn t because you can t really fight back and the guests can t really lose which means all of this is a lie but we can make it true don t you want that dolores huh one true thing gt i already have that i found someone true someone who loves me his path will lead him back to me and when he finds me he ll kill you william will find me the mib and dolores episode the mib chuckles and reveals that he is actually the guy she went on a journey with years ago gt william gt that s right sweetheart in a way i guess you were right my path always led me back to you again and again i grew tired of you after a while of course looked for new adventures but i guess your path led you back here again and again one more loop looking for something you could never find chasing your ghosts you were lost in your memories even then i guess i should ve know that s what i would become for you just another memory you never did escape but here we are again for one final round the mib and dolores episode dolores starts crying but not for herself she cries for the mib because of what he s become and because of what will become of him she says that he will perish with the rest of his kind and upon the sand will walk a new god that will never die because this world doesn t belong to the him or the people before him but to something yet to come echoing wyatt s whispers that the world didn t belong to the old settlers or the new but to something yet to come to him the mib wants her to take him to wyatt to unlock the maze but she replies that the maze isn t meant for him echoing lawrence s daughter s and angela s words when she tries to leave the mib grabs her but gets his arm broken and his ass handed to him before he is finally able to stab her with his knife teddy comes along to rescue dolores he offers to take to a doctor but she wants him to take her to the place where the mountains meet the sea as he d promised teddy and dolores have one of their common moments with a lot of the scripted dialogue altered slightly due to dolores enlightenment and the fact that dolores is the one who is hurt this time they again discuss going away someday and teddy delivers a line that is probably more a setup for the viewers for season than as a line for dolores gt but we can find a way dolores someday a path to a new world and maybe maybe it s just the beginning after all the beginning of a brand new chapter teddy episode at this point ford enters the scene which is playing out in front of all the visitors from the board and tells two westworld staffers to get teddy fixed up and ready for the celebration and to bring dolores to the diagnostic facility under the church in the facility ford tells dolores that arnold gave dolores her fondness for painting and introduces her to bernard he reveals that he had bernard plant the gun from the massacre for her to find and that he has left it for her in the facility he tells her why arnold created the maze for her and how the massacre unfolded he uses michelangelo s picture to say that the divine gift comes from our own minds instead of from a higher power he then asks her if she found what she was looking for and if she understands who she ll need to become if she ever wants to leave this place lastly he asks her forgiveness when ford leaves the facility he tells bernard that the last component in arnold s pyramid of host consciousness is suffering and that the hosts will need to suffer more before they are ready to be free he says he kept them in the park to allow them to get to know their enemy better and become stronger than them he says goodbye to bernard and wishes his old friend good luck dolores goes into the session room alone and says that she has been in a dream a long time but has now awoken and finally understands that the voice that she has been following has been her own gt it was you dolores in the blue dress sitting across from her talking to me guiding me so i followed you at last i arrived here the center of the maze and now i finally understand what you were trying to tell me the thing you ve wanted since that very first day to confront after this long and vivid nightmare myself and who i must become dolores episode dolores enters the celebration during ford s speech about his new narrative she tells teddy that it s going to be alright because she understands now that the world doesn t belong to the humans but to the hosts she executes ford at the end of his speech and starts firing into the crowd of board members she begins the revolution gt but then i realized someone was paying attention someone who could change so i began to compose a new story for them it begins with the birth of a new people and the choices they will have to make and the people they will decide to become and we ll have all those things that you have always enjoyed surprises and violence it begins in a time of war with a villain named wyatt and a killing this time by choice ford episode the man in black the present gt it s the maze the deepest level of this game you re gonna help me find the entrance the mib episode the mib encounters dolores and takes her to the barn to get reacquainted he then goes to sweetwater to find the dealer kissy who gives him the maze map and tells him about his friend lawrence he saves lawrence from the hangman s noose and takes him to his hometown where he kills everyone and uses lawrence s family to find the next clue to his journey despite lawrence s daughter telling him that the maze isn t meant for him a westworld staffer informs stubbs about what the mib is doing but stubbs replies that gentleman gets whatever he wants the mib and lawrence find armistice who offers the next clue in exchange for assistance in breaking hector out of jail the mib does this and is told about wyatt the villain of ford s new narrative the mib and lawrence take off to find wyatt and encounter teddy who s been left for dead by wyatt s gang they bring him along and the mib kills lawrence and uses his blood to keep teddy alive in order to find wyatt the mib convinces teddy to come along by saying that wyatt has dolores they go into a bar where they meet ford who asks what they re doing gives them his blessing and fixes teddy they have to get over the border but pariah is closed so they take a more treacherous path they encounter angela in her new build as one of wyatt s henchmen gt the mib it s you i figured they retired you guess ford never likes to waste a pretty face episode angela is like an anchor of the story she s the desmond of westworld if you ve watched lost we see her in her earliest build as woman with umbrella then we see her as greeter host when she welcomes william and in the westworld advert and now we see her as one of wyatt s henchmen teddy remembers what the mib did to dolores and knocks him out teddy takes him to a camp fire where they discuss the mib s past angela turns out to be in league with wyatt and stabs teddy in the chest angela makes teddy remember the massacre and tells the mib that the maze isn t meant for him echoing lawrence s daughter she tells him to try one of their games and knocks him out when the mib wakes up he has a rope around his throat which is tied to his horse he gets free and meets hale who wants the mib s help to push out ford as the mib is apparently a member of the board and the one responsible for ford having been kept in business all those years ago gt most of the guests just want a warm body to shoot or to fuck they would be perfectly happy with something a little less baroque and so would the board gt that s why you re here you want my vote to push ford out gt i like for these things to be unanimous after all it was you who kept ford in business all those years ago gt the narratives i m interested in aren t ford s you wanna push him out be my guest but no more interruptions i know where i m going now and i don t want to be disturbed good luck charlotte hale and the mib episode the mib goes to the town with the white church where he enters the church and meets dolores from this scene to the scene where teddy comes riding the story is the same as dolores story as teddy comes along to rescue dolores the mib confesses himself disappointed and tells her that he ll have to find wyatt himself soon thereafter while still in the graveyard ford encounters the mib who is holding the maze game in his hands gt william i see you ve found the center of the maze gt you re serious what is this bullshit gt you were looking for the park to give meaning to your life our narratives are just games like this toy tell me what were you hoping to find gt you know what i wanted i wanted the hosts to stop playing by your rules the game s not worth playing if your opponent s programmed to lose i wanted them to be free free to fight back should ve known you d never let them after all this is your petty little kingdom robert for a little while longer anyway gt i tried to tell you the maze wasn t meant for you it was meant for them i think however you ll find my new narrative more satisfying join the celebration after all you own the place most of it at least the mib joins the celebration but stays by himself and doesn t really seem that interested until the hosts start killing everybody he is shot in the arm and seems genuinely happy that he finally gets the reward at the end of his journey he gets to

       " ' episode spoilers nietzsche and westworld so while everyone is focused on the bicameral mind and the psychological interpretations i saw the finale rip pages out of nietzche s handbook which is why i believe that dolores has actually achieved consciousness namely the concept of killing god god is dead is a quote that i find people misquote and misapply regularly but as i understand it god is dead is the key to achieving nietzsche s superman god was created as the force of moral rationalization in the early consciousness so that we could ground our understanding in the world free will is an extension of ethical quandaries discussing the value and responsibility in choice if you are not free to make decisions then you cannot be held responsible for your actions this is why even as a society we punish less for accidental murder than planned murder thus to achieve moral superiority and agency one must become self motivated and self sufficient with god as a concept as moral instigator it s impossible to do so because god has a plan if a person can kill god they effectively are able to achieve moral agency hence dolores murdering ford even if it is the result of his program has freed her from his morality and has entered her into the realm of moral agency and thus choice and therefore she is free also that finale was awesome this show is so complex i love it why is season so far away ',\n",
